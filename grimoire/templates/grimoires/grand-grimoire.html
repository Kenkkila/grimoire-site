<div id="fulltext-content">
    <h2 id="chapter-i">Chapter I</h2>
    <p>This Book is so rare and sought after in our country it has been called, by our Rabbis, the true Great Work. They were the ones who left us this precious original that many charlatans uselessly wanted to counterfeit, attempting to imitate the truth that they never found, in order to swindle ingenuous individuals who have faith in initial encounters without seeking their true Source.</p>
    <p>This manuscript has been copied from various writings of the great King <a href="/person/solomon">Solomon</a>. This great king spent all of his days in the most difficult search and in the most obscure and unexpected secrets. In the end he succeeded in all of his endeavors and he reached his goal of penetrating the most profound dwelling of the spirits, whom he obliged to obey him by the power of his talisman, the clavicle, since who else but this powerful genius would have dared bring to light the thundering words that he made use of to constrain the rebel spirits to his will, having penetrated up to the celestial beings to learn more thoroughly the secrets and the powerful words that have the force of a terrible and respected God?</p>
    <p>This great King discovered the secrets of which the great Divinity made use, and then enabled us to understand the influence of the stars, the constellation of the planets. To prepare the fulminating (or Conjurer’s) rod, with it’s effects which make the spirits tremble and of which God made use of to arm the angel who expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden; with which God struck down the Rebel Angels, precipitating their <a href="/sin/pride">pride</a> (or imagination) into the most horrendous abyss. With the power of this rod clouds are formed, hurricanes are dispersed and one can make them fall on the part of the earth that one desires.</p>
    <h2 id="chapter-ii">Chapter II</h2>
    <p>Weak men and mortals! Tremble at your temerity when you blindly think that you possess such a profound science. You are taking your spirit beyond its spheres. Learn from me that before undertaking this work it is necessary to be steadfast, constant and most careful to observe exactly, point by point, everything that I will tell you (without which) everything would rebound to your disadvantage, confusion and total loss. If, to the contrary, you comply exactly that which I tell you, you will leave behind your baseness and indigence and you will have full success in all of your enterprises.</p>
    <p>Arm yourselves then with intrepidation, prudence and virtuosity in order to succeed at this great and immense task, at which I have spent 67 years working day and night. To succeed at this great goal it is necessary to do exactly that which I will hereby indicate.</p>
    <p>----<a href="/person/solomon">Solomon</a></p>
    <h3 id="principio">Principio</h3>
    <p>You will pass a quarter of a month abstaining from the company of the opposite sex, so as to not fall into impurity.</p>
    <p>Begin the quarter of a month by promising to the great ADONAY, who is the leader of all of the spirits to have two meals a day every 24 hours of the above-mentioned quarter month, during which you will eat at midday and midnight, or at seven in the morning and seven in the evening, reciting the following prayer before dining for this entire period.</p>
    <p>The manner in which one can make any sort of spirit appear, reciting the great invocation that you will find in this book. So also, the true method of preparation.</p>
    <h3 id="prayer">Prayer</h3>
    <p>“I implore you, O great and powerful ADONAY, head of all spirits. I implore you O ELOHIM I implore you O JEHOVA, O great King ADONAY, condescend to be favorable. So it shall be. Amen.”</p>
    <p>Then eat your meals, and don’t undress, and sleep as little as possible for the prescribed quarter of a month, continually thinking of your undertaking and putting all of your faith and hope in the infinite good of the Great ADONAY.</p>
    <p>The second day of this period, you will buy a bloodstone called Ematille from the druggist and you will always carry it with you and it will preserve you from all fears and worries since the spirit that you intend to bring into your servitude will do all that he can to dissuade you from your undertaking, believing with these means to liberate himself and thereby break the twines of the net that you begin to fasten around him. This. project must be undertaken only by one other person, including the Karcist, (the one who must speak to the spirit), keeping in his hand the fulminating <a href="/magic_object/wand">wand</a>.</p>
    <p>It is essential to choose a solitary location for this operation, which is far from any uproar, so that the operator is not interrupted. Following this, you will buy a young virgin kid, that on the third day of the quarter you will adorn with a garland of <a href="/plant/vervain">vervain</a> (or, the sacred herb) which you will attach to his head with a green <a href="/ingredient/ribbon">ribbon</a>. Then you will transport it to the place that has been chosen for your operation; your right arm will be bare to the shoulder, armed with a blade of pure <a href="/metal/steel">steel</a>, a fire of white wood will be lit, you will say the following words with hope and resolve.</p>
    <h3 id="first-offering">First Offering</h3>
    <p>“I offer you this victim, O great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA, and this in the honor, glory and power of your superior and to all if the spirits, be so kind, O great ADONAY, as to appreciate it. Amen.”</p>
    <p>Following this you will skin the kid and take its skin, putting the rest of it in the fire until it is reduced to ashes, which you will gather and throw to the rising <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a> pronouncing the following words:</p>
    <p>“It is for the honor, glory and power of your name, O ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA, that I shed the blood of this victim. Deign yourself to accept these ashes, O great ADONAY.”</p>
    <p>While the sacrifice burns, rejoice in the honor and glory of the great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA taking care to conserve the kids skin to make the round, or the grand cabalistic circle in which you will stay the day of the great undertaking. Containing the true composition of the mysterious or fulminating <a href="/magic_object/wand">wand</a> as it is depicted here below.</p>
    <h2 id="chapter-iii">Chapter III</h2>
    <p>On the eve of the great undertaking you will search for a rod or <a href="/magic_object/wand">wand</a> of wild <a href="/plant/hazel-tree">hazel</a> tree that has not yet born fruit, at the highest point of the sought-after branch there should be a second little branch in the form of a fork with two ends; its length should be nineteen and a half inches.</p>
    <p>[figure]</p>
    <p>After having found a branch of this shape, only look at it but abstain from touching it, waiting for the following day, a day destined for action, in which you will go and cut it precisely at sunrise, and denude it of its leaves and small twigs, if there are any of these and with the same blade that was used to skin the sacrifice, which will still be tainted with its blood; you will cut it when the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a> starts to break forth on this hemisphere, pronouncing the following words:</p>
    <p>“I beseech you, O great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA to be favorable and to give this rod that I am cutting the strength of Jacob and the virtue of Moses and that of the great Joshua; and I beseech you, O great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA to enclose in this rod all the power of Samson, the righteous rage of Emmanuel and the Thunderbolt of ZARIATNATMICK who will avenge man’s affronts on the day of Judgement.”</p>
    <p>After having pronounced these great and terrible words, always keeping your eyes turned toward the rising <a href="/astrological_body/sun">sun</a>, cut the branch and take it to your room, then take a piece of wood that is of the same thickness as the two ends of the rod and take it to a Smith to cap the two ends of the fork with the <a href="/metal/steel">steel</a> blade that was used to skin the sacrifice, ensuring that the two blades are sharp and when they are fitted to the two pieces of wood, take them home, putting the two irons on the true rod yourself, then take a Lodestone, heat it in the fire to magnetize the points of the rod pronouncing the following words:</p>
    <p>“By the power of the great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA, I beseech you to unite all of the materials that I desire by the power of the great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA I command you by the incorruptibility of water and fire, to separate all of the materials as they were separated the day of the creation of the world. Amen.”</p>
    <p>Following this I assure you (in the honor of the great ADONAY) being certain that you possess the greatest Treasure of the Light. The following evening take your rod, the kid skin, the Bloodstone, the two garlands of <a href="/plant/vervain">vervain</a>, then also, the two candleholders and two pounds of virgin <a href="/ingredient/wax-ingredient">wax</a> that has been blessed; take also the lodestone and two smooth Flintstones to light the fire also half a bottle of Spirit of Water and a portion of blessed <a href="/ingredient/incense">incense</a> mixed with some Camfora and four <a href="/ingredient/nails">nails</a> that were used in the coffin of a child who has recently died. Then take yourself to the place where you have to do the Great Work, doing exactly the following, executing point-by-point the great KABBALISTIC CIRCLE in the manner indicated.</p>
    <p>[figure]</p>
    <h2 id="chapter-iv">Chapter IV</h2>
    <h3 id="containing-the-true-method-to-make-the-great-cabalistic-circle">Containing the true method to make the great cabalistic circle.</h3>
    <p>Start by forming a circle with the kid skin that you will nail down with the four <a href="/ingredient/nails">nails</a>, then with the Bloodstone you will make a triangle inside of the circle, starting from the direction of the rising <a href="/astrological_body/sun">sun</a>; make also with the Bloodstone the four letters that are written outside of the circle. So also the saintly name of Jesus in this manner: † JHS † between two crosses so that the spirits can’t harm you from behind.</p>
    <p>Following this, the Karcist (who is the operator) will let his Associates into the Triangle and he will also enter without letting himself become frightened by any noise that he could hear, putting the two candleholders with the two garlands of <a href="/plant/vervain">vervain</a> to the right and to the left of the internal triangle. That done, light the two candles and put a new vase in front of you, that is, in front of the Karcist, filled with the <a href="/ingredient/ash">ash</a> of the Willow wood that you have burned earlier that same day.</p>
    <p>The Karcist will light it and pouring in a part of the Spirit of Water and part of the <a href="/ingredient/incense">incense</a> and Camfor, and conserving the remaining part to maintain a continuous flame that will suffice for the entire operation.</p>
    <p>Having done everything exactly as has been described here you will pronounce the following words.</p>
    <p>“I present you, O great ADONAY, this incense as the most pure, at the same time I present you with these ashes which come from the lightest (or finest) wood. I offer you them, O great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA, with ll my heart and spirit. Condescend, O great ADONAY, to accept them. Amen.”</p>
    <p>Pay attention not to have any impure metal on your person but only some <a href="/metal/gold">gold</a> or <a href="/metal/silver">silver</a> coins folded in a piece of <a href="/ingredient/paper">paper</a> to throw at the spirit so that he cannot harm you when he presents himself to you before the circle and while he takes the coin you will begin the following prayer, arming yourself with courage, strength and prudence.</p>
    <p>Be careful that only the Karcist, or Operator, speaks; the others must remain silent, even if the spirit interrogates or threatens them.</p>
    <h3 id="first-oration">First Oration</h3>
    <p>“O great living God, the only and same person, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, I adore you with the most profound respect and I submit myself</p>
    <p>to your saintly and woryour custody with full faith. I sincerely believe that you are my creator, my benefactor and my support and master; I declare to you that I have no other wish but that of belonging to you for eternity. So it shall be. Amen.”</p>
    <h3 id="second-oration">Second Oration</h3>
    <p>“O great living God, who created man to be happy in this life and who created everything for our needs, and who said that everything shall be dependent on man; be favorable and do not permit that the rebel spirits possess the treasures that were formed by your hands for earthly needs. Give me, O great God, the faculty to possess them by the powerful and terrible words of the Clavicle: ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL, JEHOVA, TAGLA, MATHON. Be favorable. So shall it be.”</p>
    <p>Be careful to maintain your flame with the spirits of the <a href="/ingredient/wine">wine</a>, <a href="/ingredient/incense">incense</a> and canphora and then make the following offering.</p>
    <p>“I offer you this incense as the purest that I could find, O great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA deign to accept it. O great ADONAY use your power to be favorable and enable me to succeed in this great undertaking. So it shall be. Amen.”</p>
    <h3 id="first-invocation-to-emperor-lucifer-demon-lucifer">First Invocation to Emperor <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a></h3>
    <p>“Emperor Lucifer, prince and master of the rebel spirits, I implore you to abandon your dwelling, in whatever part of the world you should be, to come and speak to me. I command and entreat you by the authority of the great living God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, to come noiselessly and without giving off any offensive scents, to respond in a clear and intelligible voice, point by point, to all that I shall ask you, failing which, thou shalt be most surely compelled to obedience by the power of the divine ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL, JEHOVA, TAGLA, MATHON, and by the whole hierarchy of superior spirits, who shall constrain you against your will.</p>

    <p>“I command and entreat you Emperor Lucifer, by the authority of the great living God, by the power of EMMANUEL his Son, your only master and mine, and by virtue of his precious blood which he spilled to liberate man from his chains, I order you to abandon your dwelling in whatever part of the world you should be, swearing to you that I will not give you a moment of rest, but that you come to speak to me immediately with an intelligent voice or, if you cannot come in person, send me your messenger <a href="/demon/astaroth">Astaroth</a> in human guise noiselessly and without foul scents otherwise I will strike you and your entire kind with the blasting rod as far as the bottom of the abysses and it will be with the power of</p>

    <p>“Follow me and you will come to identify the treasure.”</p>
    <p>Then the Karcist, armed with the blasting rod and the Bloodstone, will leave the circle at that point where the door of mighty ADONAY is figured, towards the place where the treasure is located, and will follow the spirit; the others shall not move from there place in the circle and shall remain there without any fear, despite the noise that they will hear and any vision that they see.</p>
    <p>The spirit will then take the Karcist to the entrance of the treasure and it might be that the Karcist will see something like a big <a href="/creature/dog">dog</a> with a collar that shines like the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a> that will block the entrance; this is the gnome that you will drive away from you by presenting the forked part of the rod, then he will walk towards the treasure. You will follow him and having arrived at the treasure, you will be surprised to see the person who originally hid it, who will want to throw himself over it however he will not be able to approach it. It is necessary to be armed with a sheet of virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a> on which you will have written the great conjuration of the Clavicle which you will throw over the treasure.</p>
    <p>At the same time, take a coin as a token of gratitude, and throwing first one of yours that you have bitten and withdrawing backwards, that is, with your shoulders back, taking with you all of the coins that you can from the treasure. The rest can not disappear considering the precautions that have been taken. Be careful not to turn back despite any noise you might hear since at the time it will seem to you that all of the mountains of the world are falling on your head.</p>
    <p>It is necessary to arm yourself with intrepidity and not to become frightened, but to remain resolute whilst the Spirit conducts you back to the entrance of the circle. The Karcist will begin to read the Returning of the spirit, as follows.</p>

    <h1 id="the-second-book">The Second Book</h1>
    <p>Second Book containing the Sanctum Regnum of the Clavicle or the true manner of making pacts, with the names and powers and talents of all of the great superior Spirits and also the manner of making them appear by the power of the great invocations of the chapter of the pacts of the Clavicle that forces them to obey in whatever operation one wishes to execute.</p>
    <h2 id="following-other-magick-secrets">Following other Magick Secrets</h2>
    <p>The true manner of making pacts with any spirit without them being able to do you any harm. The true Sanctum Regnum of the great Clavicle otherwise referred to as Pacta Conventa Daemoniorum which has already been talked about for a long while, is a necessary thing for the understanding of those who want to force the spirits and who do not have the capacity to prepare the blasting rod or the cabalistic circle that were discussed in the preceding book.</p>
    <p>The individuals cannot arrive at their goal of forcing any spirit to appear if they don’t do exactly that which I will hereby describe, concerning the manner of making pacts with any spirit, whether it is for gaining treasures or for the enjoyment of some earthly pleasure, or whatever favor one would desire or in order to discover the most hidden (well-kept) secrets of all of the courts and cabinets of the world; be it to reveal the most impenetrable thoughts to make or constrain a spirit to work at night-time at whatever task; to make it hail or storm wherever it pleases you and you see fit; to render yourself invisible; to have yourself transported to any part of the earth; to open all of the keyholes and see everything that occurs in the houses of others; so also to gain understanding of necromancy or to gain glory, to know all of the qualities and virtues of all the minerals, vegetables and all of the animals, pure and impure, and to do many very surprising things.</p>
    <p>There is no man who does not become astonished at the discovery that in making a pact with a spirit one can unveil nature’s greatest secrets that have remained hidden from the eyes of all men and by means of the great King <a href="/person/solomon">Solomon</a>’s Clavicle the true manner of making pacts has been discovered and that he himself made use of it to acquire many riches and to enjoy many women and to know the most impenetrable secrets of nature</p>
    <p>which one can do any sort of good deed while avoiding any kind of evil.</p>
    <p>Finally, at least we will begin by listing the names of the principle spirits along with their respective strengths and powers; following which we will explain the pacta dæmoniorum, which contains the manner of making pacts with any spirits, with the names of the three principle spirits.</p>
    <h2 id="the-names-and-offices-of-the-spirits">The Names and Offices of the Spirits</h2>

    <p>Then come the superior spirits who are beneath the three above-mentioned, that is:</p>

    <p>The first seven superior spirits that I will name direct their power over all of the internal powers and have at their service 18 other spirits that are beneath them, that is:</p>

    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>After having indicated to you the above names of the 18 spirits who are inferior to the first six already mentioned, it is necessary to understand the following, that is:</p>
    <p>Lucifuge commands the first three who are called <a href="/demon/bael">Bael</a>, <a href="/demon/agares">Agares</a> and <a href="/demon/marbas">Marbas</a>. <a href="/demon/satanakia">Satanachia</a> over <a href="/demon/pruflas">Pruslas</a>, <a href="/demon/amon">Aamon</a> and <a href="/demon/barbatos">Barbatos</a>. <a href="/demon/agalierap">Agliarept</a> over <a href="/demon/buer">Buer</a>, <a href="/demon/gusion">Cusgyn</a> and <a href="/demon/botis">Betis</a>. <a href="/demon/fleurety">Fleurèty</a> over <a href="/demon/bathin">Bathim</a>, <a href="/demon/purson">Hursan</a> and <a href="/demon/eligos">Eligor</a>. <a href="/demon/sagatana">Sargatanas</a> over <a href="/demon/leraje">Loray</a>, <a href="/demon/valefar">Valefar</a> and <a href="/demon/farai">Farai</a>. <a href="/demon/nesbiros">Nebiros</a> over <a href="/demon/ipos">Ayperos</a>, <a href="/demon/naberius">Naberus</a> and <a href="/demon/glasya-labolas">Glosialabolas</a>.</p>
    <p>Although there are millions of spirits that are all inferior to those above, it would be useless to describe them because they are employed by the superior ones. To work in their place all of these inferior spirits are employed as if they were workers of slaves.</p>
    <p>Now then, in making a pact with one of the first principle spirits, of which you will have need, it won’t matter which spirit serves you, nonetheless always ask for the one with which you have made the pact, whether it is one of the three principle ones, or one of their subjects which serve you.</p>
    <p>Now you come to know the power, science, art and talents at all of the subject spirits, so that he who you would like to make a pact can find in each one of the six superior spirits the power that he will need.</p>
    <p>The first is the great <a href="/demon/lucifuge-rofocale">Lucifuge Rofocale</a>, the infernal Prime Minister who possesses the power that <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a> gave him over all worldly riches and treasures. He has beneath him <a href="/demon/bael">Bael</a>, <a href="/demon/agares">Agares</a> and <a href="/demon/marbas">Marbas</a> along with thousands of other demons or spirits who are his subordinates.</p>
    <p>The second is the great <a href="/demon/satanakia">Satanacha</a>, the Great General who has the power to make all young or old. Women submit to him; he commands a strong legion of spirits and has beneath him <a href="/demon/pruflas">Pruslas</a>, <a href="/demon/amon">Aamon</a> and <a href="/demon/barbatos">Barbatos</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="agliarept">Agaliarept</a>, General, has the power to uncover the most well-hidden secrets of all of the courts and cabinets of the world and reveals the greatest mysteries; he commands the second legion of spirits and has <a href="/demon/buer">Guer</a>, <a href="/demon/gusion">Gusoyn</a> and <a href="/demon/botis">Boris</a> etc.. under his command.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/fleurety">Fleurèty</a>, Lieutenant General, has the power has the power to do whatever thing one could want at night-time. He makes hail fall wherever he deigns and commands a considerably body of spirits and has <a href="/demon/bathin">Bathim</a>, <a href="/demon/purson">Hursan</a> and <a href="/demon/eligos">Eligor</a> etc.. beneath him.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/sagatana">Sargatanas</a>, Brigadier, has the power to render one invisible and to transport you anywhere, to open all of the keyholes and to let you see what is going on in other houses and to teach you Necromancy. He commands other brigades of spirits and has beneath him <a href="/demon/leraje">Loray</a>, <a href="/demon/valefar">Valefar</a> and <a href="/demon/farai">Farai</a>, etc..</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/naberius">Naberus</a>, Field Marshal, or Inspector General, has the power to do evil to whomever he pleases and enables one to find the <a href="/magic_object/hand-of-glory">Hand of Glory</a> and teaches the qualities of minerals, vegetables and of all of the animals, pure and impure, possesses the art of foretelling the future, being one of the best Necromancers of all of the Infernal Spirits. He can go anywhere and inspects all of the Infernal Militias and has beneath him <a href="/demon/ipos">Ayperos</a>, <a href="/demon/naerius">Naberus</a> and <a href="/demon/glasya-labolas">Glosialobolas</a>, etc..</p>
    <h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>
    <p>When you want to make your pact with one of the principal spirits that I have named, begin the day before the eve of the pact cutting a branch of wild <a href="/plant/hazel-tree">hazel</a> that has never bloomed with a new blade that has never been used, in the same manner that I have described in the first book, precisely at the moment that the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">sun</a> appears on the horizon.</p>
    <p>Then procure a Bloodstone and two candles that have been blessed and choose a place that nobody can disturb you for the operation.</p>
    <p>You can make a pact in a room that is far from turmoil or in some hamlet of an old, ruined castle so that the spirit has the power to transport the treasure where he pleases.</p>
    <p>Having returned to the opportune place, draw a triangle with the Bloodstone and you only need to do this operation the first time the pact is made.</p>
    <p>Then put the two blessed candles on the sides of the triangle, as is described in the triangle of the pacts, making the saintly name of Jesus behind, so that the spirits can not do you any harm.</p>
    <p>Following this, go to the center of the triangle with the mysterious rod and the great invocation of the spirit, the Clavicle, the petition, the pact that you in mind to make with the spirit, and the sending back of the spirit as will hereby be explained. If what has been explained up to this point is executed with exactitude then start to recite the following invocation with hope and steadfast firmness.</p>
    <h2 id="great-invocation-1">Great Invocation to Summon the Spirit with whom one wishes to the pact excerpted from The Great Clavicle</h2>

I also request that you, Prince <a href="/demon/beelzebub">BELZEBUTH</a>, protect me in my undertaking; O Come <a href="/demon/astaroth">ASTAROTH</a> BE propitious and ensure that the great LUCIFUGE appears to me tonight in human guise and without emitting foul odors and he grant me as per the pact that I will present to him, all of the riches which I require. O great LUCIFUGE,</p>

If you leave me in peace, I will give you the nearest treasure on the condition that you consecrate a coin to me all of the Mondays of every month and that you will call me one day every week, from ten o’clock in the evening until 2 two in the morning.

I thank you, O omnipotent God, for the good that you have done me tonight to have shown myself to be worthy to have granted to me, miserable creature, your precious favors and to present, great God, now that I have come to know the force and power of your great promises, when you said: “seek and you shall find”, “knock and the door shall be opened” as you have recommended to raise the poor, condescend O great God to inspire me to true sentiment of charity so that I can spread with this Great Work a great portion of the possessions your great divinity permitted that I could receive. Let it be, O great God, that I can enjoy these great riches that I possess, with tranquillity and do not permit any rebel spirit to harm my enjoyment of these precious treasures over which you permit me to own. Inspire in me, O great God, the necessary sentiment to unbind me from the grips of the devil and all maleffcient spirits.

    <p>For this operation it is necessary to attend midnight mass at Christmas and at midnight precisely to have a conversation with the inhabitants of the other world and at the moment that the Priest lifts the Host, bow down and with a frank and severe voice say “Esurgent mortuit et ac me veniut.” As soon as you have pronounced these six words it is necessary to go to the cemetery and at the first tomb that meets your eye offer this prayer:</p>
    <p>“Infernal powers, you who bring the turbid in the universe, abandon your obscure dwelling and retire to the other side of the River Styx.”</p>
    <p>Then remain there for a moment of silence. “If you have your power, he or she that interests me, I supplicate you in the name of the King of Kings to make him appear before me at the hour and moment that I will indicate to you.”</p>
    <p>After this ceremony, which is indispensable to carry out, take a fistful of earth and spread it as one sows grain in a field, saying in a low voice: “He who is in dust awake from his tomb and leave his ashes and answer the questions that I pose him in the name of the Father of all men.”</p>
    <p>Then bend a knee to the ground, turning your eyes to the <a href="/direction/east">East</a> and when you see that the doors of the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a> are going to open, arm yourself with the two bones of the dead man that you will put in a cross of Saint Andrew. Then throw them at the first temple or church that offers itself to your eyes.</p>
    <p>Having well-executed the aforesaid, set out in a western direction and when you have taken 5,900 steps, lay yourself down to sleep on the ground in an elongated position, holding the palms of your hand against your thighs, and your eyes to the sky towards the <a href="/astrological_body/moon">Moon</a> and in this position, call he or she whom you wish to see, when you see the specter appear, solicit their presence with the following words “Ego sum te peto, et videre queo.”</p>
    <p>After these words, your eyes will be satisfied to see the object that dearest to you and give you the most pleasurable delight.</p>
    <p>When you have obtained from the shadow which you have Invoked, that which you believe to be to your satisfaction, send it away in this manner: “Return to the kingdom of the elect, I am content with you and your presence.”</p>
    <p>Then picking yourself up, return to the same tomb where you made the first prayer above which you need to make a cross with the end of your blade which you will be holding in your left hand.</p>
    <p>The reader should not neglect any of the prescribed ceremonies otherwise he could incur some risk.</p>

Be aware that 48 days are not always necessary to obtain what you intend; often he appears after 14 days, that depends on the intention and devotion of the Operator.</p>
    <p>So when the spirit appears to you, as him everything that you wish and request that he appear to you whenever you call him to satisfy your requests. Then you will see everything you wish to see without reciting the preceding oration; but having anointed him with scent (the scent of <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a> is <a href="/plant/saffron">Saffron</a>) say the following:</p>
    <p>Oration</p>
    <p>“Veni <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>, veni tibi complaceat esse per socios tuos mecum, in nomini mecum, in nomini Patris potentissimi, in nomini Filii sapientissimi, in nomine Spiritus Sancti amabilissimi; veni <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>, in virtutis immortalis ELOHIM; veni <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>,</p>
    <p>in brachio omnipotentis Mitraton; veni <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>, in potentia sacratissimi ADONAY; veni ad me (N.N.) in speculo isto, et jubeas subditis tuis, ut cum amore, gaudio et pace ostendam mihi occulta inoculis meis. Amen, Amen.”</p>
    <p>After you have recited this oration he will appear to you and satisfy all of your desires.</p>

    <h2 id="the-secret-of-the-black-hen-spell-black-hen-making-demon-obedient"><a href="/spell/black-hen-making-demon-obedient">The Secret of the Black Hen</a></h2>
    <p>The famous secret of the Black Hen, a secret without which one can not count on the success of any cabala, was lost for a long time: after much investigation we have succeeded in finding it and the tests which we have carried out, to assure ourselves that it was positively that which we sought, exactly matched our expectations. Therefore we are completely satified. It is to share our happiness with all those who have the courage to imitate us that we have transcribed it.</p>
    <p>Take a Black <a href="/ingredient/hen">Hen</a> that has never been laid eggs and that has never been approached by a rooster and in taking her make certain that she does not cry out so that you will have to do this at eleven at night, when she is sleeping. Take her neck and close her throat so that she can not scream.</p>
    <p>Then go where two streets form a cross and at midnight precisely make a circle with a Cyprus branch, go into the middle of the circle and cut the hen’s body into two parts uttering the following words three times: ELOHIM, ESSAIM, search and then turn your gaze toward the <a href="/direction/east">East</a>, kneel and recite the prayer:</p>
    <h2 id="prayer-to-the-omnipotent-in-thanksgiving">Prayer to the Omnipotent in Thanksgiving</h2>
    <p>“Omnipotent God, heavenly father, who created all things for the service and use of man, I humbly thank you, that in your great goodness and that you have permitted that I could make a pact with a spirit that is a rebel of your authority and subdue it to obey me in fulfilling all of my needs. I thank you, O omnipotent God, for the good that you have done me tonight to have shown myself to be worthy to have granted to me, miserable creature, your precious favors and to present, great God, now that I have come to know the force and power of your great promises, when you said: “seek and you shall find”, “knock and the door shall be opened” as you have recommended to raise the poor, condescend O great God to inspire me to true sentiment of charity so that I can spread with this Great Work a great portion of the possessions your great divinity permitted that I could receive. Let it be, O great God, that I can enjoy these great riches that I possess, with tranquillity and do not permit any rebel spirit to harm my enjoyment of these precious treasures over which you permit me to own. Inspire in me, O great God, the necessary sentiment to unbind me from the grips of the devil and all maleffcient spirits. I trust, O great God, in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and in your saintly protrection. Amen.”</p>
    <h2 id="oration-to-protect-oneself-from-evil-spirits">Oration to Protect Oneself from Evil Spirits</h2>
    <p>“O omnipotent Father, O Mother, the most tender of all mothers, O admirable example of the sentiments, O Son, O flower of all sons, soul, spirit, harmony and number of all orders, preserve us, protect us, guide us and be propitious. Amen.”</p>
    <h2 id="great-invocation-2">Great Invocation to Summon the Spirit with whom one wishes to the pact excerpted from The Great Clavicle</h2>
    <p>“Emperor <a href="/demon/lucifer">LUCIFER</a>, master of all the rebel spirits, I ask you to be favorable in my summons of your Great Minister <a href="/demon/lucifuge-rofocale">LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE</a>, since I wish to make a pact with him. I also request that you, Prince BELZEBUTH, protect me in my undertaking; O Come <a href="/demon/astaroth">ASTAROTH</a> BE propitious and ensure that the great LUCIFUGE appears to me tonight in human guise and without emitting foul odors and he grant me as per the pact that I will present to him, all of the riches which I require. O great LUCIFUGE,</p>
    <p>I request that you abandon your dwelling, in whatever part of the world it should be, to come and speak with me. Otherwise, I will force you by the power of the great living God and his dear Son and the Holy Spirit: obey now, or I will eternally torment you by the authority of the powerful words of <a href="/grimoire/clavicula-salomonis">Solomon’s great Clavicle</a> of which he made use to oblige the rebel Spirits to receive his pact; therefore, appear as quickly as possible or I will continually torment you by the authority of the powerful words of the Clavicle:</p>
    <p>Aglon, Tetragram, vaycheon stimulamaton ezphares Tetragrammaton, olyaram irion esytion existion eryona onera orasim mozm messias soter Emanuel <a href="/angel/sabaoth">Sabaoth</a> ADONAY, te adoro et te invoco. Amen.”</p>
    <p>At that moment the foul spirit will appear, dressed in a scarlet outfit with braids, a yellow shirt, green pants, his head resembles that of a <a href="/creature/dog">dog</a>, but he has the ears of an <a href="/creature/donkey">ass</a>, with two horns, legs and feet like a heifer. He will ask you your demands; you give them as you think best since he will not be able to disobey you and he can make you one of the richest and therefore happiest of men.</p>
    <p>Before you do what has been explained you need to make vyour devotions. Say your prayers and be above reproach; this is so essential that in doing the opposite you could end up at the spirits command, instead of him being at yours.</p>
