    <p>After diligent Search for this Book,
    having by happy accident met with
    it, and procured it for my use;
    since I am minded to communicate
    it to the Curious and Worthy, I shall give
    you some account of the Authors,
    and their Work. The Authors are <em>Kiranus</em> and <em>Harpocration</em>.
    <em>Kiranus</em> was King of <em>Persia</em>, to
    which Crown none but Magicians could be
    admitted, and of which Kingdom the famous
    <em>Zoroastres</em> the first Magician, was. This work
    of his had been for many Ages turned out of
    the <em>Persian</em> into the <em>Syriack, Arabick,</em> and
    most Eastern Tongues. <em>Harpocration</em>, as the
    Learned are of opinion, was a <em>Græcian</em>.
    There were several of this Name. One of
    them wrote a Lexicon upon the Ten Greek
    Orators. <em>Jacobus Maussacus</em> published him
    with Notes and a critical Discourse upon
    him; where he mentions several <em>Harpocrations</em>,
    and among the rest ours, as the Sequel
    will prove. He is at a mighty loss about one <em>Harpocration</em>,
    whom <em>Tertullian</em> mentions in his Book <em>De Corona Militis</em>. <em>Tertullian</em>&#39;s Words
    are these; <em>Liberum, eundem apud</em> Ægyptios
    <em>Osirin,</em> Harpocration <em>industriá hederatum argumentatur,
    quod hedera natura sit cerebrum ab
    heluco defensare.</em> In English thus; <em>Harpocration
    does argue, that</em> Bacchus, <em>the same with</em>
    Osiris <em>among the</em> Ægyptians, <em>is pictured with
    Ivy on purpose, because it is the nature of Ivy
    to defend the Brain from Drunkennes.</em> Now
    <em>Maussacus</em>, after he had confuted the Mistakes
    of several Commentators upon these words
    of <em>Tertullian</em>, who would make him to mean
    <em>Harpocration</em> that wrote the <em>Lexicon</em>, comes
    to one Commentator, whom he thinks in the
    right. These are the Words of <em>Maussacus</em>.
    &quot;<em>Jacobus Pamelius</em>, the last Commentator upon
    <em>Tertullian</em>, has taken another, and a quite
    new course: For he thinks that Harpocration,
    whom Tertullian mentions, is the same
    with him, whose Manuscript Book πρί φυσικῶν
    is kept in the Vatican. And
    if we relie on his Credit, <em>Tertullian</em>&#39;s words
    may not unfitly be accommodated to that
    Author, who wrote about the Natural
    Virtues of things, since it belongs to Natural
    Philosophy to teach, that the Ivy is
    sacred to <em>Bacchus</em>, because it defends the
    Brain from Drunkenness. But I am afraid
    small heed is to be given to these things,
    and that <em>Pamèlius</em> speaks as an Ear rather
    than as an Eye-witness. For I remember I
    very carefully perused at <em>Auspurg</em> a Catalogue
    of all the Books in the Vatican Library,
    lent me by <em>David Heschœlius</em>, with
    other Catalogues of Libraries at <em>Auspurg,
    Bavaria, Vienna,</em> the <em>Emperor</em>&#39;s, St. <em>Mark</em> at
    <em>Venice</em>, and St. <em>Laurence</em> at <em>Florence</em>, and
    I met not with any thing of <em>Harpocration</em>&#39;s
    but the Lexicon, neither when I was in the
    <em>Vatican</em> at <em>Rome</em>, to compare the Printed
    <em>Harpocations</em> with a Manuscript that was
    there, could I meet with any thing besides
    concerning him, nor could I learn
    any thing from two <em>Grecians</em>, the Father
    and the Son, who had the care of writing
    out the Manuscript Books, and who have
    the Catalogue of that Library by heart.
    But I would not have <em>Pamelius</em> therefore
    rashly censured, nor his Opinion receded
    from, because perhaps, he did not, as from
    himself, affirm, that <em>Harpocration</em>&#39;s Manuscript
    περί φυσικῶν δυνάμεων, was in the Vatican;
    but he has been told so by some,
    either whose Memory or Honesty failed
    them, as by <em>Simlerus</em>, who first told him in
    his <em>Epitome Bibliothecæ Gesnerianæ</em>, that a
    Book of <em>Kirani</em> and <em>Harpocration</em>
    σικῶν δυνάμεων was in the <em>Vatican</em> at <em>Rome</em>.
    But, till all know more certainly and firmly,
    that <em>Harpocration</em>&#39;s Book πρί φυσικῶν
    is somewhere extant, and till it
    is tried, whether that Passage be in him,
    which is cited by <em>Tertullian</em>, it is my judgment
    that the business must hang in suspence,
    and the Trial (as Lawyers talk)
    must be put off, till another day. For, to
    say any thing positively about the Interpretation
    of this place, and immediately to
    vouch it for Truth, would be no man&#39;s act
    who remembers he is a Man: It was wittily
    said by a wise man of old
    άμνησία τό πλέον μέρος όι βροτοῖσιν. <em>Ignorance is in the greatest
    share of Mortals</em>, which though we find
    consentaneous to Truth in other Cases, yet
    then most, when we take upon us to open
    and interpret some Places in the Writings
    of the Ancients, that are controverted, and
    not well understood. But the Learned
    <em>Puteans</em>, while this was in the Press, told
    me, they read in a Catalogue, which their
    Father had a most compleat one of all the
    Libraries in <em>Italy</em>, that <em>Harpocration</em>&#39;s Book
    περί φυσικῶν δυνάμεων, written Alphabetically,
    was in the Library of Cardinal St. <em>Angelo</em>,
    which is now fallen to his Brother
    Cardinal <em>Farnesius</em>. Which thing, how far
    it perswades me, that that Author does not
    differ much from ours, I need not declare:
    for the Alphabetical order, which we find
    he observed, what does it argue, but that
    he was a Lexicographer, not much unlike
    ours in his way of writing, though he differ
    in the Subject? I wish I could obtain
    that Treasure, that I might publish it with
    this of ours, we should not be so much in
    the Dark about this controverted place in
    <em>Tertullian</em>, and it would presently appear
    whether the Author of these two Books
    were the same, after which we are so solicitously
    inquisitive.&quot; Now that Treasure
    which <em>Maussacus</em> so much wisht for,
    I here offer to you: for it is the Book of <em>Kirani</em>
    and <em>Harpocration</em>, as <em>Gesner&#39;s Bibliotheca</em> cites
    it; and it goes Alphabetically as <em>Putean</em> says
    his <em>Harpocration</em> did in the Cardinal&#39;s Library.
    And as for the controverted Place in
    <em>Tertullian</em>, consult but the Letter Θ, <em>pag</em>. 26.
    of the first Book, and you may be satisfied,
    that <em>Tertullian</em> quoted no other <em>Harpocration</em>
    but ours. Read on to <em>pag</em>. 28. and you have
    this Passage. <em>&quot;That you may be without Drunkenness,
    and for all favour and health</em>; In
    the Stone <em>Thyrsites</em> engrave the Bird <em>Thyr</em>,
    and Bacchus holding the Bird, and under
    the stone enclose the Root of the Herb,
    (meaning <em>Ivy</em>) and wear it, and you will
    be without Drunkenness, and will have,
    Favour with all men; and moreover you
    will be without danger in the Palace For
    this is a divine <em>Dionysiack</em>, and weakens the
    strength of <em>Bacchus</em>. For so sayes <em>Harpocration.</em>&quot;
    And that learned Father <em>Tertullian</em>
    sayes, <em>Harpocration argues</em>, that Bacchus, <em>the same with Osiris among the</em> Ægyptians, <em>is pictured
    with Ivy on purpose, because it is the Nature
    of Ivy to defend the Brain from Drunkenness.</em>
    So that <em>Harpocration</em>&#39;s and <em>Tertullian</em>&#39;s
    Sense are altogether the same. And this must
    be the Book which no less a Man than <em>Tertullian</em>
    quoted as an Author, and which many
    Learned Men since him have longed to
    see, but could not. And <em>Barthius</em>, another
    Learned Critick of his time, giving an account
    of some <em>Greek</em> Physicians, who were
    never yet published, strangely extolls <em>Kirani</em>.
    For whereas others only transcribed one
    from another, and little is to be had from any
    one of them, that may not be found in <em>Hippocrates</em>
    and <em>Galen</em>; <em>Kirani</em> has many prodigious
    Virtues of things both in Medicine, and
    other Affairs, contained in the Subjects which
    he mentions. <em>Barthius</em> moreover sayes, he
    saw this curious Manuscript in the possession
    of <em>Henry Ellenberger</em>, primary Physician to
    the Court at <em>Magdeburg</em>, who may very well
    be reckoned among the greatest Physicians
    of his Age. <em>Barthius</em> would by all means have
    had it published, being a Book of such infinite
    value: And the rather because it has some
    thing of <em>Harpocration</em> in it, who is so highly
    and deservedly valued by Learned Men. And
    he reckons it to be <em>Tertullian</em>&#39;s <em>Harpocration</em>,
    as <em>Pamelius</em> before him imagined, and as by
    comparing the Passages in these two Authors
    we have already proved. So that it is not
    only my Opinion, but it is the Conjecture of
    <em>Pamelius</em>, who could not after his most inquisitive
    Search and Research, meet with
    <em>Harpocration</em>; and it is the clear Judgment of
    that vastly Learned Man <em>Barthius</em>, who saw
    <em>Harpocration</em>. And I the rather mention <em>Barthius</em>,
    because this Translation is from a Copy
    of that very Manuscript which he saw in
    Dr. <em>Ellenberger</em>&#39;s hand. Being thus far satisfied
    of the Original Authors, our next business
    will be to enquire concerning the Translators
    of them. <em>Barthius</em> conjectures that the
    Translation out of the <em>Agarene</em>, or <em>Arabick</em>
    Language into the <em>Greek</em>, was the Work of
    a Monk of Constantinople, in the time of <em>Manuel</em>
    or <em>Emanuel Comnenus</em>, the Son of <em>Calojoannes</em>;
    the Conclusion of whose Life and
    Empire was foretold them both in two Greek
    Oracles. The Father&#39;s in this; Ω πῶς γεννήση βρωμα δεινῶν κοράκαν!
    i.e. <em>Oh, how shalt thou
    become the Food of unlucky Crows!</em> And
    this <em>Calojoannes</em> died somewhere in a place
    called in Greek <em>Crows-Nest</em>. And the Son&#39;s
    in this, Αλλ ύς άτη σε κερδανεῖ λόγου, i. e. <em>Certainly
    the last Syllable of a Word shall gain thee.</em>
    Now (ηλ) the last Syllable (and the two last
    Letters) of Μανουήλ, that Emperor&#39;s Name,
    signifies Eight and Thirty: And he reigned so
    many years. Besides, Historians write, how
    at that time the Greek Nation was mightily
    addicted to Magick. And so, in all likelihood,
    this Greek Interpreter must be well
    skilled therein. The next Translation out of
    <em>Greek</em> into <em>Latine</em>, was made about three or
    four hundred years since, by one <em>Gerardus</em>, a
    most excellent Physitian of that time. <em>Trithemius</em>
    sirnames him <em>Fulginas</em>; <em>Raphael Volaterranus</em>,
    <em>Suchonas</em>; but <em>Gesner</em> and the most
    call him <em>Cremomensit</em>.</p>
    <p>This Latin Translation has been quoted by
    many at the second hand. But I never met
    with any that saw so much as a Manuscript of
    it, till <em>Barthius</em> (as we told you) saw it in
    Dr. <em>Ellenberger</em>&#39;s Hand, who kept it as a precious
    Jewel, and a great Rarity. He had wrote
    in the Book with his own Hand, <em>That he received
    this Book in Manuscript, as a singular
    Boon, from the most Illustrious Lady, the Lady</em>
    ELEONOR, <em>Landgravess of</em> Hesse, <em>descended
    from the Family of the Dukes of</em> Wirtemberg,
    <em>at</em> Darmstad, Anno M.DC.IX. This Book
    had, about an hundred Years before that, been
    in the possession of one <em>Waltherus de</em> VIELBEL,
    <em>Præpositus, S. L.</em> by whose Donation it belonged
    to David <em>Vielbel</em>, Anno M.D.XXX. After
    Dr. <em>Ellenberger</em>&#39;s Death, this Treasure fell
    to his Son <em>Christian William Ellenberger</em>, who
    being a Soldier, bestowed it upon a Physician,
    his Acquaintance and Friend. This Physician
    printed it privately; for neither his own,
    nor the Printer&#39;s, nor the place&#39;s Name is
    printed. But he says, he was forced to leave
    the University, and to retire into the Countrey,
    by reason of the Plague, of which the
    Famous <em>Sennertus</em> died, and he only took this
    curious Manuscript with him, and in his Retirement
    fitted it for the Press. It bears
    Date M.D.C.XXXVIII. So that it seems, but
    a few Copies were printed, and those privately
    distributed; one of which with some difficulty
    I procured.</p>
    <p>As for the Book, it seems to be one of that
    sort of Books which Men in the <em>Acts</em>, who
    used curious Arts, brought together, and
    burnt, the Price whereof being counted, was
    found to be fifty thousand pieces of Silver.
    But since such miraculous Zeal is ceased, with
    the rest of Miracles, this piece of Curiosity
    needs no more undergo Martyrdom, than
    Christians now need sell all, and live upon a
    common Stock, as they did in the Fourth of
    the <em>Acts</em>, especially since <em>Tertullian</em>, one of the
    Fathers, quoted it. It contains, I confess,
    much Curiosity in it; but nothing to endammage
    Christianity, where it is so firmly settled:
    And if there be something that deserves
    the Sponge, yet all ought not therefore to be
    obliterated; nor must the Child be thrown
    away with the Bathe. But the time the Authors
    lived in, requires some Grains of Allowance.
    And those hidden specifick Vertues of
    things, and strange Methods in curing Diseases,
    may atone for the Scraps of Vanity and
    Superstition that are in the Book. I find, that
    former impolite Ages, were nevertheless very
    curious in Affairs of Philosophy, and in that
    regard surpassed our better cultivated, and
    more literate Age. I find also, that great Deference
    was given to our Authors: Insomuch
    that <em>Albertus Magnus</em> (who is quite spoiled
    by unskilful Transcribers) quotes this very
    Book. For in <em>Trinum Magicum</em>, p. 168, there
    is this Passage, <em>Magicalis cognitio existit in
    speculatione rationum, &amp; in speculatione naturalium,
    secundum quod antiquis Auctoribus examinavi
    &amp; percepi, imo &amp; egomet</em> Albertus, <em>ut in
    pluribus veritatem inveni, &amp; veritatem suppomo
    (eo modo) quo ab aliquo ex</em> CHYRANDIS <em>libro,
    &amp; libro</em> ALCHORAT <em>(sc. eruere licuit)</em>
    Where it is plain enough, that it was first
    written CYRANIDIS <em>libro &amp;</em> ARPOCRATIONIS,
    and by mistake so miserably depraved.
    But since <em>Albertus</em>, many learned Men of the
    Moderns have made use of <em>Kirani</em>, as <em>Gesner,
    Aldrovandu, Balduinus Ronsæus,</em> and others.
    As for Medicines, I know no Specifick mentioned
    by the Ancients, and very few by the
    Moderns, which he has not, besides many
    that are to be met with no where else. But
    because for some Ages past, to have been a
    Magician, or a Wise Man, was Capital, it will
    be necessary to remove some Prejudices received
    against Magick or Wisdom, which I
    think cannot better be done, than by shewing
    what true Magick or Wisdom is, and how far
    is is consistent with the Holy Scriptures, which
    seem most to condemn it. Now, Magick I
    take to be <em>a skill which by a certain Power, yet
    not supernatural, but created, is able to do unusual
    things, whose Causes are beyond the common
    Comprehension of Men.</em> In this Definition we
    exclude Miracles, as supernaturally wrought
    by the Finger of GOD. And by excluding
    from it all Diabolical Contract, we must intend
    no other than Magick purely natural, or
    the Skill of managing Nature by Art, so as
    to accomplish strange things. We know it
    was the Ambition of Knowledge that ruined
    our First Parents; but they had to do in that
    Affair with the Devil. And I make no doubt,
    but they had the Knowledge of Good, before
    they tasted of the Tree of Knowledge of
    Good and Evil, the latter part whereof has almost
    obliterated the former in their posterity,
    though the former is that which we aim at,
    and which <em>Adam</em> undoubtedly had in his Innocency.
    For all the Learned hold him to
    have had an exact Knowledge of the Vertues
    of things before the Fall. And this Knowledge
    was delivered from Father to Son before
    the Flood, till <em>Seth</em> engraved it on Pillars,
    and so by those Monuments, as well as
    by <em>Noah</em>&#39;s oral Tradition, the Post-Diluvians
    were instructed in the same. <em>Abraham</em>
    is said to have had skill in Astrology. And
    the Scriptures testifie, what skill in the Magick
    of Imagination his Grand-son <em>Jacob</em> had, from
    his pilled Rods, that he set before the Flocks,
    when they conceived. <em>Moses</em> is not only accounted
    a Magician by Heathen Writers, but
    the Scriptures testifie, how he was learned in
    all the Wisdom of the <em>Ægyptians</em>, whereof
    Magick was no small Share, as their Magicians
    working Wonder for Wonder with <em>Moses</em>,
    a little while, prove.</p>
    <p>We read also of wise Charming in the Psalms,
    of which sort of Charming we have a Form in
    this Book, <em>pag</em>. 152. And if we should narrowly
    enquire into all the Books of Scripture, we
    might perceive, that the Authors of them
    were skilled in the power of Nature, as well
    as of Godliness, the former whereof, was, and
    is called Magick. Nay, the <em>Magi</em> of the East,
    were more devout in following their Star, to
    worship our Saviour, than all the Nation of
    the Jews. So that Magick (unless with <em>Jannes</em>,
    and <em>Jambres</em>, we use it in opposition against
    GOD) is not only lawful, but commendable.</p>
    <p>But whereas <em>Kirani</em> undertakes to cast out,
    and drive away evil Spirits by natural Means,
    this is but what <em>Tobias</em> in the <em>Apocrypha</em> did by
    the persuasion of the Angel: For <em>he remembred
    the words of</em> Raphael, <em>and took coals for perfumes,
    and put the Heart and Liver of the Fish
    thereupon, and made a perfume. The which smell
    when the evil Spirit had smelled, he fled into the
    utmost parts of</em> Ægypt, <em>whom the Angel bound.</em>
    The Angel likewise told <em>Tobias</em>, that <em>as for
    the Gall, anoynt a Man that has Whiteness in his
    Eyes, and he shall be healed.</em> And <em>he took hold
    of his Father, and sprinkled of the Gall in his
    Fathers Eyes, saying, be of good hope my Father.
    And when his Eyes began to prick, he rubbed them;
    And the Whiteness pilled away from the corners of
    his Eyes, and then he saw his Son.</em> Now <em>Kirani</em>
    so far explains the <em>Apocrypha</em>, as to tell us
    the Heart, the Liver and the Gall of what
    Fish it is, that does these things.</p>
    <p>I remember, I have heard of a Physician,
    eminent for the cure of Lunaticks, who is said
    to have used suffumigations or perfumes of
    something in his Cures. And such you may
    meet with here.</p>
    <p>You must take notice, that in the first Book,
    in the concatenation of the Vertues of
    things according to the four <em>Elements</em>, the
    Plants are analogous to Earth, Fishes to Water,
    Birds to Air, and Stones to Fire. For
    Nature&#39;s Interpreters do ascribe miraculous
    Virtues to Gemmus; and without doubt those
    efficacious and abstruse properties descend from
    a peculiar influence of the Stars, and a better
    temperament of the Elements. And is it a
    great Argument it is so, because in the Eastern
    Countries, where the Sun is hottest, the best
    Stones are found. And therefore <em>Kirani</em> ascribes
    fiery Virtues to Stones, and makes one
    to be under one Planet, and another under
    another. But it were endless to give an account
    of all the Rarities herein contained.
    Therefore with Piety and Wisdom peruse
    these four Books themselves. The Worth and
    Rarity whereof, I am afraid, has tempted some
    dishonest person to rob the <em>Vatican</em>, and other
    Libraries of them. But are now at length
    (maugre Envy and ill Will,) communicated to
    you, for your Benefit, Farewell.</p>
    <h2 id="epistle-dedicatory" data-magellan-target="epistle-dedicatory">Epistle Dedicatory</h2>
    <p>I Admire and commend the sigacity of
    Your Prudence, who, tho&#39; You be experienced
    in such things as are above the Nature of our Sphere, and have
    by Contemplation penetrated to things beyond
    the Seventh Heaven; yet you disdain
    not to look down upon the most inferiour
    terrene Experiments: For You requested me
    to translate this Physick Book out of the
    Greek into the Latine Tongue: a thing much
    more easily said than done. However, being
    obliged by your Charity and Bounty to me,
    I could not disobey your Commands. And
    because there are, as you know, <em>divers Translations
    out of the</em> Agarene <em>Tongue into the Greek</em>,
    I have industriously and faithfully followed
    the Greek Book that you gave me, in all
    things. Neither was I willing to pass by the
    very two Prologues, tho&#39; rugged, and abstracted,
    as it were, from the most ancient
    Titles: not so much minding the Words,
    which are of a Barbarian Sterility, as the
    Sense of Utility. If therefore you find any
    thing altered, let it not be imputed to my
    Unfaithfulness or Ill-will, but to common
    Mistake: <em>For there is no man so wise, but has
    some Mark of Folly in him.</em> Yet I would
    have you know, that there is among the
    <em>Grecians</em> a certain <em>Book of</em> Alexander <em>the
    Great about the seven Herbs of the seven Planets,</em>
    and another that is called <em>Thessala his
    Mystery to</em> Hermes (that is, <em>Mercury</em>) <em>of the
    twelve Herbs attributed to the twelve Signs, and
    of seven other Herbs by seven other Stars.</em>
    Which, if they should happen to come to my
    hands or to yours, because they imitate a
    Celestial Dignity, may very well be prefixt to
    this work.</p>
    <p>This Book therefore is translated at <em>Constantinople,
    Manuel</em> being Emperor, <em>Anno
    Christi 1168. Indictione secundá</em>. <em>The Book of
    Physical Virtues, Sympathies, and Cures, gathered
    out of two Books,</em> viz. <em>The Experience of</em>
    Kiranides Kirani, <em>King of the</em> Persians, <em>and
    out of the Book of</em> Harpocration <em>the</em> Alexandrian
    <em>to his own Daughter</em>. And the first Book
    of <em>Kirani</em> was thus, and so we will suppose
    it was the great Gift of the <em>Agarene</em> to him.
    He that received this Book from GOD, was
    <em>Hermes Trismegistus</em>, well known to all men.
    Do not therefore deliver it to the Ignorant,
    but keep it to thy self as a great Possession:
    and let the Father, if it may so be, deliver
    it only to his Children instead of Gold for
    the efficacy of its Action, adjuring them, as
    sacred Children, only to keep it secret.</p>
    <p>This Book was engraven in <em>Syriack</em> Letters
    upon an Iron Pillar, in a Book indeed interpreted
    by me formerly. But in this Book
    which is called <em>Kiranides</em>, <em>twenty four Stones,
    twenty four Fishes, twenty four Herbs, and
    twenty four Birds are written of.</em> The Virtues
    of every one of these are complex and
    intermixt with the rest, for the Cure, and also
    the Delight of mortal Bodies: And truly
    the invention or beginning is from Almighty
    GOD; for by his Wisdom we obtain the Action
    of Herbs, Fishes and Birds, and the Virtue
    of Stones, and the Nature of Animals and
    wild Beasts, and moreover, the mutual permixtions
    of them, and their Communities and
    Proprieties, since the knowledge &amp; skill of many
    things comes from GOD into men. Therefore
    dividing into three <em>Kiranides</em>; I have
    declared the whole Composure in order of the
    Alphabet, according as any thing worthy
    Remarque occurred. And they are called
    Κοιράνιδες, (<em>Koiranides</em> or Queens) because
    these are the Queens of all the rest of my
    Books. And we found <em>Kirani</em> of the King
    of the <em>Persians</em>, which is the first of these
    Books.</p>
    <p>This indeed is the Prologue of <em>Harpocration</em>,
    and it is thus;</p>
    <p><em>The Therapeutick</em> (that is, the Curatory)
    Book of Syria, Harpocration wrote it to his
    own Daughter. When formerly I travelled through the
    Country of <em>Babylon</em>, I found a City, <em>Seleutica</em>
    by Name, the History whereof I have
    written; but we have no occasion to make
    any long Discourse upon that City, because
    we would not alwayes be upon Preambles.
    Now therefore let us return to our proposed
    Intention. Then, says he, I saw another City
    yet, seventeen <em>Persian</em> Miles distance from
    <em>Seleutica</em>, which <em>Alexander of Macedon</em> demolished;
    afterwards <em>Seleutica</em> was built, under
    the Dominion of the <em>Persians</em>, and inhabited
    by the Nation of the Persians. This is called
    little <em>Alexandria</em>, which is near <em>Babylon</em>. And
    this is the History of Syria,</p>
    <p>The third Year it happened, that I found
    an old man skill&#39;d in Foreign Learning, and
    in the Greek Tongue: But he said, he was a
    <em>Syrian</em> by Nation, was taken captive, and
    lived there: and he went round the
    City with me, and shewed me every thing.
    And when we came to a certain place about
    four Miles distance from the City, we saw a
    Pillar, with a great Tower, which the Inhabitants
    of Syria said they brought from the
    Ædifice of <em>Solomon</em>, and placed it there for
    the Health and Cure of the Men of that City.
    Looking therefore well upon it, I found it
    was written in strange Letters. The old
    Man therefore; assoon as he was asked by
    me, agreed to shew me, and I willingly lent
    an ear to him, while he discoursed, and expounded
    the Barbarous Letters that were upon
    the Pillar in the Æolick Tongue. My
    Son, saith he, You see three Towers standing
    here, one of which is five Miles distant,
    another two and a half, and another four.
    These were built by the Giants, who had a
    mind to climb into Heaven; for this their impious
    Madness some of them were struck with
    Thunder, others through the just Judgment
    of GOD, knew not themselves, and the rest
    were cast into the Isle of Crete, into which,
    God, being angry with them, hurled them.
    The old Man therefore, who shewed me these
    things, bade me measure the greatness of the
    Stone with a Cord: Therefore measuring
    that which was nigh, I found it two and
    thirty Cubits high, and seventy nine broad;
    and there were two hundred and eight steps
    to it. We also saw a Sacred Cloyster, and in
    the middle of the Cloyster there was a Temple,
    having three hundred sixty five Silver
    Steps, and sixty more of Gold, by which we
    went up to pray to GOD. And he told me
    the Mysteries of the Living GOD, which I
    will not tell to all. I was indeed willing to
    be informed of other things, and propounded
    several other things; but my main design
    was to be informed of the Pillar: And the
    old Man drawing aside a Silken Veil, shewed
    strange and foreign Letters engraven upon it.
    And because he was skilled in my Tongue, I
    entreated and begged of him, that he would
    candidly and without Envy make plain all
    things to me. Now the Things that were
    read upon the Pillar, were these;</p>
    <p><em>This is a manifold Table of the irue Example,
    alwayes having, and knowing, and fore-knowing
    the Immissions of the Divinity.</em></p>
    <p>This Second Book may in the Name of
    GOD be called <em>Kirani</em>. <em>The Second Book going
    out of the little</em> Archaicus Syriacus, as the
    clear Flood of <em>Euphrates</em> runs swiftly. <em>These
    Things were engraven on Iron Pillars.</em> “Both
    whatever things were formerly, or shall be
    hereafter, equal Conjunctions of them in
    Virtues of Stones, and with them also both
    the Plants of the Earth, and the Fishes of
    the Deep, and the Fowls of the Air, tempering
    Virtue with Virtue in the greater
    Quaternary: For these things are good for
    Men that were formerly, and shall be hereafter;
    because being immortal bearing a
    mortal Body, carried through the Air,
    bound with the evil Bonds of Necessity; as
    GOD himself said, governing mortal Bodies,
    thou art made in Sin, and encompassed
    with the sordidness of Necessity, as any
    one in Fetters, unless he get out, and in
    Bonds and Chains; so Necessity straitens
    thee in hard Bonds: But when thou art got
    out of the dull Body, thou shalt truly see
    GOD, that rules in the Air and in the Cloud,
    who causes Thunder and Earthquake,
    Lightning and Thunder-bolts, and who
    shakes the Foundations of the Earth, and
    the Waters of the Sea. These are the Works
    of GOD the Father Eternal. O Soul
    GOD shews these things, and all Contraries.”</p>
    <p>But this Book was buried in the Fens of
    <em>Syria</em>, engraven upon an Iron Pillar all over
    Steel or Endanick, as we said before in the
    former Book, which is called <em>Archaicus</em>: But
    in this, that is called <em>Kiranides</em>, four and
    twenty Stones, four and twenty Fishes of the
    Sea, four and twenty Herbs, and four and
    twenty Birds are written of, The Virtue of
    every one of these shall be complicate and
    mixt with the other Virtues, that asswaging
    and strengthening this mortal Body, we may
    enjoy Health Eternal: <em>For none gives Spirit to
    Man but GOD</em>; for all things are written
    according to the Construction of GOD:
    And this is the Beginning. For tho&#39; the Beginnings
    or Prologues of each have a Dissonance;
    yet henceforth they begin as it were
    in Consonance. And Harpocration sayes thus.</p>

    Eagle, a Bird. &#39;Aετίτης, the Eagle-stone.
    Aετός, the Eagle, a Fish without Scales.</em></p>
    <p><em>Άμπελος λευκή</em> is a most holy and admirable
    Herb; it is also divine, and is called <em>βρυωνία,
    Bryony</em>. The Male-Eagle is King of all Birds.
    The Eagle-stone is with Child and Rattles. The
    Eagle, a Fish without Scales, is like the Hawkfish,
    only somewhat blacker, and like a little
    Thorn-back. For <em>Convulsions and Epilepsies</em>;
    Now the Root of the Herb worn about the
    Neck, cures People of Convulsions and the falling
    Sickness. <em>For the bloody Flux, and spitting
    of Blood</em>; And four Spoonfulls of the
    Juice given to any in a bloody Flux cure him.
    <em>Against Drunkenness</em>; And if a man, otherwise
    well, have a mind to drink much Drink,
    let him drink of the Juice of the Leaves ℥j.
    and as much Vinegar fasting. <em>That one be
    not made drunk</em>; And if one drink the Stone
    that is in the Head of the Fish, with Wine,
    he shall not perceive at all what he drinks.
    And if he carry the Stone about his Neck,
    without the Herb, if he drink a Gallon of
    strong Wine, he shall not perceive it. <em>To
    make Excretion</em>. The Stones, when the
    Grapes are prest out, bruised with a little of
    the said Stone, and given in Drink to such as
    have paralytick Genitals, will make them stand.
    And it is good for them that cannot perform
    the Act of Generation. <em>For broken Bones of
    the Hands, and bloody Fluxes, and any Disease
    of the Arse. And GOD himself gave this, that
    mortal Body might not fail.</em> Take of White
    Wine a Pint and an half, with the tender
    Buds of the Herb XL, and Coriars Galls ℥iij.
    Boyl two thirds away; this cures Dysenteries
    and Lienteries, and broken Bones of the hands,
    and every Disease of the Arse, and every such
    thing, if it be drunk. A Decoction of the
    Leaves also, drunk with a little Honey, asswages
    every Disease of the Neck: And if you
    add a little of the Stone, that Disease will
    neither encrease, nor return again. I have
    seen several, who have had their Bones crushed,
    and I admired how they were cured.
    One can testifie this, who was twenty five
    years old, and is now restored without pain
    by this Divine Medicine and Nature: Nor
    indeed were there any Hands before; all the
    Flesh was withered upon one, nor had it any Sense;
    but all the Members besides had
    their feeling. <em>Also to make broken Bones whole,
    I found in this Sacred Book thus:</em> Give the
    Juice of the Leaves of the Herb, and as much
    white Wine mixt with it, to drink for seven
    days. And the Eagle-Stone worn about one,
    and the Fish eaten, do the same thing. <em>Keep
    this Gist of GOD, and give it not to thine own
    Son!</em> <em>For the Thumbs and incurable Nails</em>:
    When the Nail of the Thumb falls, and is incurable,
    and is alwayes running, infuse Dates
    bruised in white Wine, and lay them sometimes
    on alone, chewed, and sometimes with
    Oyl of Roses. <em>For Warts</em>: And for Warts,
    which come either all over the Body, or in
    any Part, burn the Branches or Wood of
    Vine, and apply the Water that comes out
    with the Smoak of the Vine-Leaf, or give it
    to drink, and they will all fall off: <em>Teach
    man this!</em> So the Dung of an Eagle applied,
    will cure: The Stone applied, and the Fat
    of the Fish anointed, does also cure. <em>For
    Putrefaction of the Gums, and the Jaws, and for
    cancerous and eating Ulcers in the whole Body.</em>
    Of the Juice of the Leaves ℥iij. Alum ℥iv.
    crude <em>Misy</em> ℥iv. Manna ℥iv. Illyrick Iris ℥j.
    Vitriol ℥iv. dissolved till they be dry; for
    this purges and fills ulcerous and eating Sores,
    and it stops a supervening Inflammation. And
    this is far greater. <em>For Putrefaction of the
    Tongue, and Mortification of the Gums</em>. But
    now we tell you something that is great. We
    saw something marcid and cancerous in the
    Tongue, which was like also to mortifie the
    Gums; therefore by applying the Juice of
    the Leaves mixt with Honey, it was cured;
    then strewing on dry <em>Iris</em>, the Ulcer filled
    up. <em>For all Breaches, and a</em> Polypus, <em>and
    Frettings, and Eatings, and Humors, and
    whatever happens about the Nose, a Divine Medicine</em>.
    Of the Juice of the Leaves ℥iv. Manna,
    Vitriol, Frankincense, <em>Misy</em>, <em>Aristolochia</em>,
    each three ounces: Rub them till all is dry,
    and use the Divine Virtue. <em>For Baldness and
    Shedding of the Hair, Sores, Scars, and any
    Diseases about the Head</em>: Apply the Juice of
    the Herb and the Juice of <em>Potamogeiton</em>, and
    the Juice of <em>Seseli</em> skillfully mixt, anoynt for
    three days. <em>A Divine Medicine to keep the Teeth
    sound and firm, which I would not keep from
    you</em>. Of the Juice of the Grapes ℥j. or viii
    Spoonfuls, the Bark of Mulbery-Tree Root
    ℥vj. Boyl it to half, and give it to wash the
    Mouth for three or five or seven days, and
    your Teeth will never ake. If one will diligently
    consider, the Vine will cure all Diseases
    from the Head to the Feet. This Herb
    is called <em>THEOdorica</em>, i.e. <em>Given of GOD</em>.
    <em>Kiranus</em> and <em>Harpocration</em> do thus far agree.</p>
    <p>Then <em>Kiranus</em> brings something new, and
    says, <em>For Urine and Stool</em>; The Sprouts, I
    say, of the first Budding of this Herb, boyled
    and eaten, provoke Urine and Stool. But
    both the Leaves, and the Root, and the Fruit
    have a very hot and sharp Virtue. <em>For the
    King&#39;s Evil, and eating Flesh, and putrid Ulcers
    and Gangrenes</em>. And it has also another
    very famous Virtue and Divine Efficacy; for
    it cures the King&#39;s Evil, and putrid Ulcers and
    Gangrenes, and eating Sores, made up with
    <em>Aristolochia</em> into Plaster. And its Root rosted
    brings a good Colour into the Face, and a
    tender Skin. <em>And it takes out Moles, Corns, and
    Freckles;</em> Mixt with Flower of bitter Vetch
    and Fœnugreek, it takes away Corns, Freckles
    and black Moles. And boiled with Oyl
    till it congeals, it is good for the same. And
    the Root broken in Wine, takes away Lividness
    of the Eyes and Whitlows. <em>For a Swelling</em>.
    It an ends any Ulcer of the Genitals, and
    dissipates and disperses Swellings. <em>For the
    Epilepsie</em>. An ounce of it given every day for
    a Year with <em>Oxymel</em>, cures it. <em>For the Apoplexy
    and Swimming in the Head, and Biting of
    Serpents, and Miscarriage</em>. It is also good for
    Apoplectick and Vertiginous Persons: Give
    ℥ij, and it quickly cures such as are bitten by
    Serpents; It corrupts the Birth also, and disturbs
    the Belly and the Sense; and applied,
    it brings away the Secundine, and drunk, it
    moves Urine. Eighteen grains of it drunk
    for thirty days, wastes the Spleen. Made into
    a Plaster with Figs, it is good for the
    same. It is boyled for hot Insessions for purging
    of the <em>Matrix</em>. It also moderately purgeth
    the Belly. And its Fruit in an Oyntment
    and Plaster, is good for the Scurf and Leprosie.
    The Juice of the Herb drunk in Broth,
    causes Milk. Drunk and anointed with Oyl,
    it is good for Epaticks. Its Leaves also in a
    Cataplasm with Wine, are good for all Ulcers.
    And applied, they are good for Rheumatick
    Swellings. And we may say further,
    <em>It is good for all things to him that useth it with
    Caution.</em></p>
    <p>And there are two sorts of it. The first is
    called the white Vine, which some call Bryony,
    others Snake-Grape; others Celidonia, others
    <em><a target="_blank" href="http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B5%E1%BC%B0%CF%83%CE%AC%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BE%CE%B9%CF%82">μίλητον</a></em> others
    <em><a target="_blank" href="http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%88%CE%AF%CE%BB%CF%89%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD">ψίλωθρον</a></em>, others <em>αρχισωστικη</em>,
    others <em>Kethedron</em>. The Buds, and Leaves,
    and Claspers of this are like the Domestick
    Vine, but they are thicker, and implicated
    With the adjacent Fruits, catching with their
    Claspers; and it has a red Grape-like Fruit,
    wherewith Hides have their Hair fetcht off,
    or are prepared. And the second sort of it
    is called the <em>black Vine</em>, which they also call
    Bryony; and some <em><a target="_blank" href="http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%A7%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%81%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%AC%CF%82">χειρώνιον</a></em>, having Leaves
    like Ivy, but the great ones like Bind-weed,
    but greater; this also applies itself to, and
    takes hold of Trees with its Claspers. And its
    Fruit is like Grapes; they are green in the
    beginning, and when they are ripe, they are
    black without, but like Box within. And its
    Sprouts also at the first budding may be boyled
    like Pot-herbs; and they are diuretick,
    and force the <em>Menstrua</em>; they cure the Spleen.
    The Roots are very good for Splenetick Persons,
    and the whole Herb is proper for such
    as are Epileptick and Vertiginous. And its
    Leaf in a Cataplasm with Wine, is good to
    eat away proud Flesh, and for wrested and
    dislocated Limbs, and for Relaxations; and
    further, it has a Virtue like to the former.</p>
    <p>And the white Vine has other Efficacies
    secular and delightful, so that being applied,
    it does not only give any man Sobriety, but
    causes Delight. <em>So says</em> Kiranus <em>this place</em>,
    After the Dissonance of them both, there began
    <em>Harpocration</em> his Speech: <em>O blessed Herb!
    Conducter of the Gods, and a Royal Conducter,
    more powerful than all Herbs, having the Principality
    of Earth, and Heaven, and Air, and
    dissolving all Power! O Grape bearing Drink!
    maist thou loosen the Limbs, cause Sleep! No
    Speech nor Body shall expel thee; but thou
    findest out whatever things are in the Minds of
    Mortals, and what Mysteries they have hidden
    in their Mind. The Vine makes manifest
    all Secrets, and all things that shall be concealed
    by Writing, or by Medicine, or by Enchantment,
    or by the Sword, or by Science: For
    these may be said to be the Mysteries of the
    Vine.</em> And it has other mundane things also
    which are not unprofitable to Mortals, yea
    they bring Delight and Joy. Therefor thus
    I read on: The holy Speech, as Kirani had
    it. <em>For Joy and Exultation.</em> O Blessed Queen
    bestowed of GOD, most holy Mother, and
    more Divine than all Plants! first Nature affects
    the Grape, the Grape makes heavenly
    Wine! Before you have said this, send the
    Cup, Bowl or Flagon about, of which all do
    drink, and they break out in Joy, no man
    complaining or asking. For <a target="_blank" href="https://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%87%CE%AF%CE%B1"><em>ἐνοχία</em></a>, i.e. <em>Exultation</em>.
    The Juice of the Grape drunk
    causes great Joy. Plant it in every place.
    For neither the Solemnities of the Gods, nor
    of Mortals, who have a term in their Life;
    nor what things in Life do come, nor what
    things now go out, nor some of those things
    that are acted in Life, can be done without
    this Plant. Also occult things require the
    planting of it. <em>For people troubles with Quartane
    Agnes</em>; It yet remains for me to speak
    of the certain <em>Cacodemon</em> (or evil Spirit) which
    is call&#39;d a Quartanary, who is not easily conquered
    by five Fortitudes of the first Decan
    of <em>Capricorn</em>, because he sees not, nor hears;
    for he is without a Head. Therefore take the
    Grape having four Seeds, take out the Kernels
    with your Nails, and not with your
    Mouth, and put them in a course Cloth,
    and hang them about your Neck, and it will
    cause Health. And the Stone that is in the
    Head of the Fish, hung about the Neck, takes
    away a Quartane. Therefore take the Eagle-Stone,
    and engrave also an Eagle upon it,
    and under the Stone put the Kernels of the
    Grape, and the top of the Feathers of an
    Eagles wing; and if you have not an Eagle,
    of an Hawks, and enclosing it, wear it. For
    it will preserve you from all the foresaid Occasions
    of Evil: Moreover it will give you
    power to speak, and to have friendly conferences
    with Great Men; and it is good for
    many other things; all which I will not declare.</p>

    of the Eye. And the Bird hath the same Nature;
    for if the Female dies, the Male will
    not pair with another; and the Female does
    the same. <em>For Love between a Man and his
    Wife</em>. If a Man carry the Heart of a Male
    Crow, and a Woman the Heart of the Female,
    they will agree between themselves
    all their Life-time; and this Miracle is certain.
    <em>For Dyspnoïck, Epileptick, and Nephritick
    People</em>. Take, I say, one Beril Stone,
    and engrave a Crow upon it, and under its
    feet a Crab; enclose also a little Savine,
    and a little of the Heart of a Bird under the
    Stone, wear it as you will: for it is good
    for Dypsnoïck, Epileptick and Nephritick
    Persons. <em>For Joy and Exultation, and Acquisition
    and Union, and Conjugal Love</em>: And
    it will make the Bearer chearful and rich:

    <em>For a Miracle</em>. The Eyes of the Bird <em>Glaux</em>,
    and of the Fish <em>Glaucus</em>, bruise them with a

    <p><em>Draconthea</em> is an Herb, having Seed like
    the eyes of a Dragon, broad leaves, is bad
    altogether. The <em>Woodpecker</em> is a Bird known
    to all, as big as a Quail, it perforates Oaks,
    Olive trees and Nut trees, that it may make
    a Nest in the middle of the Wood. The
    <em>Dragon</em> is a Sea fish without scales: After
    therefore that it has voided much, and would
    do over great violence, the Clouds of Heaven
    snatch it into the Air, and dash it against
    the Mountains, tearing it Limb from
    Limb, so that is it no more. <em>That one be not
    hurt</em>; It is two forked, like a Horses Tail,
    two fingers in length. Putting it in Oyl,
    keep it. Putting it in Oyl indeed, it preserves
    all People from fascination and infirmity.
    For I saw this upon the Sea coasts of
    the <em>Assyrian</em> Countrey. <em>Dendrites</em> is a Stone,
    which is known by many; This grows in
    <em>India</em> in Rocky maritime places about six
    fingers high. <em>For Hearing</em>; The Seed of the
    Herb <em>Draconthea</em> worn sharpens the Sight,
    and removes a little pain in the Head. The
    Feather also of the Bird, with a little of the
    Stone <em>Dendrites</em>, cures the <em>Hemicrania</em>
    or half Head-ach. In like manner the
    Feather of the Bird, and a little of the Fish
    bruised and applied, suddenly cures every
    Head-ach. Let us not therefore mistake for
    the difficult finding of the great <em>Draconthea</em>,
    but those things which are done, are from
    the little <em>Draconthea</em>, which is two hand-breadths
    high, and it is as the Fish or the

    Doors, Locks, Dolts, and to tame wild Beasts,
    and to be beloved of all, and to acquire all
    things, that whatever you please may be done
    for you</em>. And if one obtain the hole of
    Tree, in which the young ones of the Woodpecker
    are, he shall carry the Herb which
    knows, and touching it opens: For if it be
    made of Clay or Chalk, the dirt will fall:
    If of Stone it bursts: If a wooden Board or
    iron Plate be so fastned with Nails, all things
    cleave and break in pieces upon the touch
    of the Herb, and the Woodpecker opens and
    takes out her young ones. If any one therefore
    have got this Herb, he will do many
    things, which are not now lawful to mention,
    as of the mod Divine Nature, which Man
    cannot perform. If therefore any man engrave
    a Woodpecker in the Stone <em>Dendrites</em>,
    and a Sea-Dragon under its feet, and enclose
    the Herb underneath it, which the Woodpecker
    found and carried, every Gate will
    open to him, and Bolts and Locks. Salvage
    Beasts will also obey him, and come to tameness;
    he shall also be beloved and observed
    of all, and whatsoever he hath a
    mind to, he shall acquire and perform. <em>Mercury</em>
    was a most accursed Pagan, and was
    worshipped as a God: but I worship <em>Christ</em>,
    and do unwillingly write of <em>Mercury</em>. <em>O the
    Blessedness of the Gods!</em> <em>Mercury</em> is an Animal
    unknown to GOD, and also his Nature.
    For who can find out the generation of Men?
    He is not, yea, a deceiver, Thou art wise,
    and instructing hast given understanding in
    the Pillar, <em>Thus far Nature</em>. But he that
    carries it, shall learn those things that are in
    the Gods, shall open Locks, and loose Chains,
    shall pacifie all wild Beasts by the will which
    is in Heaven, shall asswage the waves of the
    terrible Sea, shall chase away all Devils,
    and shall appear good to all men. But we
    will alter for the purpose. If perchance you
    should not find the Herb, which opens the
    shut Nest of the Woodpecker, enclose under
    the engraven Stone the top of a Feather of
    the Birds wings and the Heart, and one feed
    of the Herb <em>Draconthea</em>, and the Stone or
    the Brain of the Fish. For being so carried,
    they give sharp-sightedness to the Eyes,
    cure the Head-ach, and expel all Diseases of
    the Eyes and Head from the Bearer. Moreover
    they represent him rich and potent to
    all Men.</p>

    Stings; it also drives away nocturnal Phantasms,
    and all Witchcraft, and is good also
    for those that are troubled with the Stone.
    Being worn, it confers the Grace and Vertue
    of Prudence. <em>Saturnius</em> himself wore it, and
    <em>Phaos</em> in Heaven; and in Earth it possesses
    Gold and Silver; it destroys Infirmity, and
    cruel Poverty, and the evil Bonds of Necessity,
    that which gives Trouble is not good,
    but forces every Earth, beating Men with
    the Degree of Fortune, binding them in Necessities.
    A certain Saturnine King <em>Kiranis</em>
    <em>Κυλινδράτης</em>, turning and rolling circular upon
    the Centre, with uncorrupt, and never-failing
    Changes, whirling all things from the
    <em>East</em> to the <em>West</em>, in the seven Arctick, i.e.
    <em>North</em>, Stars, holding and moving all strange
    things. Soul, be thou content and sufficient
    in those things which thou actest in failing
    Time! and tho&#39; thou be after Prægnation,
    yet presently thou knowest GOD in the
    Air, and in the Clouds; thou sufferest Infirmity
    upon the Earth, in which being an
    Inhabitant, thou art tormented. O blessed
    Soul! being thenceforth immortal, cease from
    corporeal Labours; tho&#39; in these thou be fixt
    to the Body, yet seek Heavenly things, or
    from whence Water is? If thou wilt learn, I will
    declare to thee all things which thou bidst
    me. Heaven is Water and Fire, the Stars
    are visible, and unspeakable Darkness is above
    the Gods. And a Sphere rolling from
    <em>East</em> to <em>West</em>. And that which moves all things
    in the Sphære with wakeful Winds, sets in the
    Sea. It brings Lightning, and dissolves the
    Air, it strikes with Thunder, and flashes out
    flaming Fire; it gives sweet Rain, and gives
    all Meat good for the Belly. And the Divine
    Virtue, which does this, itself hides all things
    that are Earth-born, Roots of Herbs, which
    are abroad among divers Generations of Men;
    and they are given for all four-footed Beasts,
    creeping things, and Fowls of the Air, which
    spontaneously do all things in their Nests
    and Dens for Man, all well coloured and
    green. Let what I said before suffice thee;
    I tell thee in Prose, and show unto thee all
    the Divinations of the Soul concerning all
    Virtues; I will tell thee more, when they are
    revealed. For I have told future things in
    Metre, or Verse, concerning the fore-knowledge
    of other Animals. <em>For the præscience of
    those things that are in Heaven and in Earth,
    and what any one has in his Soul; and whatever
    things are done in Climates and Cities, and

    flying in the Air, which is called <a target="_blank" href="http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%94%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%88"><em>ἔποψ</em></a>, <em>upupa</em>,
    or Houp, of seven Colours, having a Crest on
    his Head, the height of two Fingers, which
    extends and contracts. And it is of four Colours,
    that it may be directed to the four
    Seasons of the Year. This Bird is called <em>Cucubas</em>,
    as it is written concerning the same, in
    a former Book, that is called <em>Archaicus</em>. And
    this Animal is sacred. Take therefore this
    Bird, and tear it in pieces, and while it is
    panting, swallow its Heart, turning to the
    Sun, in the beginning of the first, or eighth
    Hour, on <em>Saturday</em>, the Moon being Oriental,
    and drink upon it Milk of a Black Cow,
    with a little Honey in the Drink. See that
    you swallow the Heart sound and entire,
    and you will foreknow what things will be
    in Heaven, and what on Earth, and whatever
    any one has in his Soul, or whatever
    is done in Climates, and in Cities, and what
    will come to all Men. And this will be the
    Composition of the Honey; Of Honey ℔j,
    ℥β. living Magnet powdered ℥ij. and tender
    Stalks of the Herb Eryngo ℥vij. When these
    are bruised, make them up with the Honey,
    And you may have another Magnet, wherein
    a <em>Cucubas</em>, i.e. an Houp is engraven, all which
    you must dip in the Composition of the Honey.
    And when you would foreknow any
    thing, first taste it with the Finger, and put
    the engraven Load-stone about your Neck,
    and you shall foreknow whatever you please,
    And if you put another Liver and Heart of
    a <em>Cucusa</em> into the Confection, it will be better,
    because it will make you of a stronger
    Memory. And that the Heart may not be
    corrupted in him that eats it, by six-footed
    Creatures, because he that eats this Honey,
    and swallows this Heart, uses to breed
    many Lice; it is necessary, that he be anointed
    first with this Oyl. Take of Oyl ℥vijβ.
    of Staves-acre bruised ℥ij. beat them well up
    into one, put it up, and keep it in readiness.
    And when there is occasion for it, then anoint
    your self in Bed. <em>If therefore thou foreknowest,
    foretel to me, whether the Soul be mortal, or
    immortal?</em> He answering, saith, <em>Hear, my Son!
    Very many false Sophisters are mistaken in the
    Understanding of the immortal Soul, but it discerns
    it self Why is it, that the Body is at rest
    in Bed, and the Soul is conversant in its proper
    place, i.e. in the Air, whence also we took
    this Soul, and sees what things are done in other
    Climates? Many times also there is a sympathy,
    as between the Mother and the Child, and
    it is solicitous for the Body in which it inhabits,
    and before the time foresees and divines future
    things, whether they be good or evil, which is
    called a Dream. Then it returns to the Body, and its
    proper Habitation, and rising it searches out. Hence
    it may appear to thee, that the Soul is immortal
    and incorporeal.</em> Thus says <em>Harpocration</em>, finishing
    this Letter in this place. But <em>Kiranis</em> in
    some things sayes other wise; and in other
    things agreeing, he sayes concerning the eating
    of the <em>Houp</em>, that from it there is Præscience
    of all worldly things. Then he said
    this; Because the Head and Heart and the utmost Root
    of Eryngo is hard to be found;
    if you will find it without difficulty, you
    must do thus: Take the Seed of Eryngo and
    the Earth on which it grows, and put the

    it, as it becomes you, fasting and chast, and
    you will find the <em>Gorgon</em>&#39;s head. Keep this,

    the Hairs of a <em>Phoca</em>, the Seal, which are between
    his Nose and his Mouth, and the

    of the Houp, and the Roots of the <em>Gorgon</em>

    <em>Chrysanthemum</em>, i.e. the Juice of the Herb <em>Plumaria</em>
    or <em>Strechas</em>, and the extremity of the
    heart of the Seal, and moreover the Crest of
    a Houp&#39;s head also; it were better if you
    had of all the foresaid sorts. Which you
    must wrap up with a little Moss with <em>Thymiana</em>
    of four sorts, and put it in the skin of
    an <em>Ichneumon</em>, or Seal, or Stag, or Crow, or
    Vultur, and wear it chastly. And if you guild
    the outside, it will be better, for you will acquire
    whatever you have a mind to, you will
    be beloved of Men and Women, and you
    will appear reverend, and peaceful, and quiet:
    you will tame wild Beasts, and conquer
    your Enemies. And if you put the right
    eye of a Wolf into the foresaid things, you
    will overcome all wild Beasts, and you will
    acquire by all things. Devils and wild Beasts
    will fly you, and you will be most happy,
    and healthful, and altogether unhurt. For I
    mixt also the Rennet of a Sea-Calf, I overcame
    all my Enemies, and I was invincible.
    For he that carries this Phylactery, shall have
    Gifts from GOD, which he hoped not for,
    and he shall be honoured on every hand, conquering
    all men in Word and Work, deliveing [sic]
    from all danger, and from the Devil, and

    <p><em>Thyrsites</em> or <em>Thyrsus</em> the Herb of <em>Bacchus</em>,
    fruitful and profitable for all things. <em>Thyr</em>
    is a Bird like the Hawk of the Sea, having a
    divine Efficacy. <em>Thyrsite</em> is a Stone like to
    Coral. <em>Thynnus</em>, a Tuny, is a Sea-fish, and
    is eaten, like to a Whiting, which being
    great is known indeed. <em>Balkera</em> is <em>Bacchus</em>
    his Plant. In the Feasts of <em>Bacchus</em> they put

    and they will thank you, as if they were
    merry. <em>For Discord at Feast</em>; And if you
    cut the Wing or the top of a Feather of the
    Bird <em>Thyr</em> with a Sword that is all Iron, and
    put it into a Vessel of Wine, saying over it
    the Name of <em>Bacchus</em>, and when you have a
    mind, make them that are sate down spill it,
    that they may shed blood and beat one another,
    and it will be so. <em>That you may be
    without Drunkenness, and for all favour and

    is a Bird, which is called <em>Iynx</em>, as
    <em>Kiranus</em> says in the Verse of Theocritus; for
    Example&#39;s sake:</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0228%3Atext%3DId.%3Apoem%3D2">῏Ιυγξ, ἕλκε τὺ τῆνον ἐμὸν ποτὶ δῶμα τὸν ἄνδρα.</a>
    Per te, Iynx, meus ille domum vir quæso
    trahatur!
    <em>Pray</em> Iynx! <em>Fetch my Husband home again!</em></p>
    <p>Some call it <em>Jugius Ales</em>. <em>Kynædius</em> is a Fowl,
    and feeds like a Quail turning back its neck,
    as <em>Harpocration</em> sayes. This has three Stones
    about its neck, it has a long tongue, and is
    often dedicated to <em>Venus</em>. <em>Kynædius</em> a Sea-fish,
    is about fix fingers in greatness, it has a
    broad head like an <em>Uletinus</em>. It is a round
    Fish, of a translucid Body, so that its Backbone
    appears through its Body, as through
    a Glass; and it abounds in the Sea of <em>Syria</em>
    and <em>Palestine</em>, and of <em>Syria</em> of <em>Lybia</em>. This
    therefore has two Stones, which also have
    their proper actions, as we shall mention
    hereafter. And they are in the head. And it
    has also another Stone in the third Joynt of
    the back towards the Tail, which is most
    powerful, and is requisite in the Spell or Ligature
    of <a target="_blank" href="http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%88%CF%86%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7">Ἀφροδίτη</a>, i.e. <em>Venus</em>. The Stone
    <em>Kynædius</em> was unknown, because it is exceeding
    scarce, and is called <em>Opisianus</em> (όψίμοι)
    i.e. late or slow. For it is Saturnine. This
    Stone is double or twofold: One is obscure
    and black; the other is black indeed, but
    bright and shining like Glass. This is that
    which many seek, and do not know it: for
    it is the Dragon&#39;s stone. If therefore with a
    little of the Herb and Vulture&#39;s dung you
    make a Fume under a Peach-Tree, the Leaves
    will fall. <em>That a man&#39;s Member cannot be
    erect, till what is laid be removed</em>. And if one
    lay the Herb under the Pillow, he that lies
    upon it shall not erect, and if you give a little
    of the Herb powdered in drink to a
    Man, he will not erect to coition for seven
    dayes. <em>That a Cock may not tread an Hen</em>;
    Give it to a Cock in Bran or Paste, and he
    will not tread a Hen. <em>That a man for one
    day may be Κύναιδοι,</em> i.e. <em>a Fornicator</em>; That
    which is in the Fish <em>Kynædius</em>, in the third
    Joynt of the backbone, if you give it in
    meat or drink, a man will be a manifest Fornicator
    for one day. <em>To make a Cock tread a
    Cock</em>; If you give it to a Cock with Paste,
    he will get upon other Cocks, and upon any
    Male Animal. If therefore any thing take
    this Stone, it will get upon the like animal,
    as upon a Female. And the aforesaid stone
    does all these things. <em>To obtain favour and
    friendship</em>; If anyone carry the Tongue of
    the Bird in a Plate of Gold, he shall have
    Favour, and be beloved of all. <em>To make
    Men soft</em>; if the ends of the wings, of the
    Flesh (I mean) not of the Feathers, be
    secretly given to a Man, or to any Male Animal,
    he will become soft, and do female
    works. <em>For Favour</em>; And if any one carry
    the right eye under an immaculate Saphire
    stone, whereon <em>Venus</em> is engraven, he
    will be gracious and acceptable to all, and
    will overcome in every Consistory. And the
    left eye carried by a Woman, will do the
    same. <em>To make the Eyes bloodshot</em>; The Blood put
    in a plate for a <em>Collyrium</em>, and found, makes the
    eyes bloodshot. <em>For a Tertian and a Quartan
    Ague</em>; And the Heart tied about one, when
    the Moon is in the Wane, cures People of
    Tertian and Quartan Agues. <em>For an incurable
    Head-ach</em>; And the Brain of the Bird given
    secretly in Drink or Meat, eases an incurable
    Head-ach. <em>For Hepatick Persons</em>; And
    its Liver boyled with Salt and Water cures
    Hepatick Persons. <em>Of Goddess</em> Venus <em>her Girdle</em>;
    The kind of <em>Venus</em>. The first and strong
    <em>Cestus</em>, i.e. Girdle, mollifies the hearts
    of Men, and of all Animals, and the Natures
    of the Males especially, so that the touching
    or carrying of this makes them soft and effeminate.
    Further also; Upon the Stone <em>Opfarius</em>
    engrave a Man having his Privities cut
    off, placed or lying at his Feet, and his hands
    contracted underneath; and himself reaching
    down to his Privities, and behind his back
    let there be Venus, having back to back, she
    turning her self, and seeing him. Enclose
    therefore the Stone of the Fish <em>Cynædius</em>. But
    if you have not one of them which are under
    the head, you must put underneath the
    Root of the Herb, and the end of the Bird&#39;s
    left wing. Enclose it in a large Gold Box,
    and you must put it into a thong of the nerve
    of a Hawk&#39;s Stomach, let it be thin, sewing
    it in the middle of the thong or nerve, that
    it do not appear. This is that which is painted
    in the head of <em>Venus</em>, comprehended in
    a thong or ligature, which is called <em>Cestus</em>.
    <em>That a male may not erect</em>; If any one touch
    a Male with the thong or ligature, he will
    not erect, and if he carries it unknowingly,
    he grows effeminate. And if he carry any of
    the Stone of the Fish, he will be altogether
    luxurious, not returning to his Nature. And
    if a Woman carry this ligature, none will carnally
    lie with her. For the Man cannot erect.
    And the measure of the ligature in respect of
    breadth, must be two fingers; of length, five
    palms. <em>Another Preparation of Venus</em>; There
    is also another Vessel or Preparation of <em>Venus</em>,
    which the Queens of Venus carry in pure
    Gold, and whoever else are able. These also
    must be in a ligature, which is made of a
    nerve in such a manner, as that the stones
    appear not, having a Sculpture, as is subjoyned.
    And the first must be (<em>Lapis Sulphureus</em>)
    <em>Lechnitis</em> or <em>Kerannitis</em> in the middle of the
    thong or ligature, having <em>Mars</em> armed engraven.
    In this let there be Diamond stones
    sewed, having <em>Venus</em> with a thorn about her
    feet. And again on the other side two immaculate
    winged Creatures, having <em>Venus</em> tied
    by her hair to Love standing by. Again also
    other two stones on each side, and in like
    manner a <em>Sardinian</em> engraven, having on each
    side a Sun drawn with four Colts, that is, a
    Coach, and a Moon with two Bulls, each stone
    having each: And other two stones on each
    side, having <em>Mercury</em> engraven, with the rod
    of a Scepter in his right hand: And other
    two <em>Anankite</em>, i.e. true Unions or white Pearl,
    having on each side Erachmites, i.e. reins, the
    Goddess <em>Nemesis</em> having her foot upon a
    wheel, and holding a Rod. And other two
    immaculate Pearls, being on each side not
    engraven, and put in the <em>Cesius</em>; so that in all
    there are thirteen Stones fixt in Golden Cases,
    and so sewed in a ligature, that they may
    not be seen by the Crowd. And there is a
    twofold holy ligature, and it follows: Another
    Stone may be carried, hung about the
    neck, which is called <a target="_blank" href="http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82">Σεληνίτης</a> i.e. Lunar
    Stone, in which the Encrease of the Moon
    and its Divinity appears. And let it have a
    Moon engraven, and underneath the Stone
    the Root of barren <em>Selinum</em>, that is,
    Parsly, in a Gold Case. And this is worn
    about the neck. <em>For wonderful and magnificent
    Acts</em>; This Mystery worn makes the wearer
    divine, and he is in veneration and adored
    by all. For many Kings carry it under-hand,
    or within their Crown, as a <em>Cestus</em>, so that
    it may be seen of none. And they say, that
    a <em>Selenites</em> worn in a Ring does the same. But
    that we may not destroy our Boo , let this
    Discourse suffice, for it has great Virtues.
    Wherefore, my Son! I have expounded and
    written these things with great study and labour.
    And know this, that no one else has
    it. Wherefore give this Divine Mystery to no man.</p>

    will die of a <em>Diarrhea</em>. <em>It is good for great

    discoursed this by the divine power. Some
    therefore of the boughs of the Mulberry tree
    are upright, others look down to the ground,
    and they have large Buds like an Egg. If any
    man then shall stand upright on his feet,
    and shall look towards the South-west wind,
    and with two fingers of his left hand shall
    raise the bud of the twig of a Branch that
    looks upward, extending and pulling it towards

    and shall tie it up, he will stop spitting of

    they call Anacardia; those indeed that look

    dayes, and those that look downward, cure
    the superior. And this is that for the Flux

    and for the <em>Exochades</em> or outer, make inunctions.
    And in the Name of GOD use this
    Ligature. In a little Stone engrave the Fish
    <em>Mormyrus</em>, and enclose it in an Iron Box, and
    put under it a Bud of Mulberry-tree looking

    the Spring time. <em>Xiphias</em> a kind of Sapphire,
    a stone known to all, this is as plentiful as

    <em>Xiphius</em>, the Bird, is a kind of Hawk, which

    are mistaken. But in the Country of

    the Seed have a watrish pale Colour. The
    Estrich is a known Bird. The Sea-Cow is an
    edible Fish, well coloured and known. The
    immaculate Saphire is dedicated to <em>Venus</em>.
    Therefore the Preparation of the Herb is in
    this manner; <em>For spent and barren Women, and
    for Coition, and for such as have a watry and thin
    seed, and which cannot conceive, and such as
    are withered and dry: For this is arid and delectable,

    Confection of <em>Aromate aridis</em> is thus, <em>Costue</em> ℥iij.
    Spikenard ℥β. (<em>in another Book</em>, ℥ij.) <em>Carpobalsamum</em>

    Roses exungulated ℥iiij. Musk ℈β. Powder
    the dry things very finely, and sift them well.
    Then rub the <em>Storax</em> a long time apart, and
    then with the beaten Roses and Balsam, and
    all mixt together, make Trochises: Afterwards
    suffumigate them, and dry them in a
    θυινον, <em>thyinum</em> of Tree-Moss and <em>Storax</em>, and
    Mastich, and Quails Claws, and <em>Costus</em>, which
    being dried, put them up in a Glass Vessel,
    and when you have occasion for Conception,
    powder to Trochises. And this is <em>Confectio
    aromatis sicca</em>. And the Bird Estrich has an
    <em>Echidirum</em>, which is called <em>suffivium aridum</em>,
    the inner Skin of the Gizzard: This powdered,
    and given in Drink secretly, <em>procures Love
    and Luxury</em>. And the Stone of the <em>Echinus</em>,
    i.e. of the Gizzard of an Estrich, with one Grain
    of <em>Satryion</em>, powdered and given in Meat or
    Drink secretly, <em>procures great Intenseness to them
    especially, who are impotent in Coition.</em> And the
    stone it self, only hung about the Neck, <em>causes
    good Digestion, and Intenseness in Coition</em>. And
    the Stone of the right Temple of the Sea-Cow,
    carried about one, causes Intenseness,
    or Erection. And the left Stone does the contrary.
    And the Fat of the Fish causes great
    Delights, beaten up, or dissolved with Honey,
    and anointed on both Genitals. Engrave
    therefore upon a Saphire-stone an Estrich
    holding a Sea-Cow in its Mouth, and put
    underneath a grain of <em>Satyrium</em> and a little
    of the Stone, which is in the <em>Echinus</em> or Gizzard

    <p>The Virtue of the Herb therefore is strong
    as Iron, <em>viz. it breaks Apostemes, Kernels,
    Glands, and all things that are purulent.</em> And
    you shall cause a Plaster or Oyntment to be
    laid on but for three hours, then take it away,
    and you will find the Body marked
    and hurt: But in the hard Bodies you may let
    it lie on longer. And after incision use those
    things, which cleanse and draw, and then
    Healers. And thïs is the Rosary. Of the
    Herb <em>Batrachia</em> ℥iv. Arsenick ℥iv. <em>Chalcitis</em>
    ℥iv. <em>Lathyridon</em> ℥iv. the Breasts of <em>Cantharides</em>,

    quick Lime ℥j. (in another place ℥viij.) Oyl
    of Cedar, or Roses, or <em>Costus</em> what is sufficient;
    French Soap ℥iv. Beat them together
    carefully, and make a Plaster, and lay it up
    in a Glass Vessel. Use it, and take care you
    lay it not upon a Nerve or Muscle, and make
    a Convulsion. And it is good also for an
    <em>Ægilops</em> and <em>Trichiasis</em>, applied after they appear
    to be risen. The hairs also of a Seal
    which are found between its Nose and its
    Mouth, the greater and harsher of them
    pluckt, with the middle of a Seal&#39;s Heart
    and the Heart of a Houp, and a little of the
    Liver of a Seal, and some <em>Chrysanthemum</em> or
    <em>Stoechas</em> or herb <em>Plumeria</em>, of Ants herb, and
    <em>lynx</em>, of the Tongue of an Estrich, and a little
    Musk in Deer&#39;s Skin, and tie up the right
    Eye of a Wolf; and keep it for a great Phylactery
    <em>for all Friendship, and obtaining of Victory.
    For it dissolves all Enmity, and confers
    Friendship, it also delivers from all necessity and
    difficulty of Times, and from danger, and from
    all tempests and waves of the Sea, and from
    wild Beasts, and from Pirate and Thieves by
    Sea or Land, and from Devils and Sickness
    for it affords health, and good acts, and good
    works, opportunity, and abundance of all good
    things, and truly it is the great Protection of
    GOD,</em> especially if it have the Root or
    Fruit of Pæony in it. And the Nails of a
    Seal&#39;s hands, carried about one or worn, frustrate
    all Treacheries and Fascinations. Therefore
    it will not be inconvenient neither, to
    put a Nail of the right hand into this Phylactery.
    And the Hairs of a Seal put into an
    Unguent, and tied about one in a Girdle,
    cures <em>all pain of the Loyns and Kidneys.</em> Being
    put also in the Shooes they cure <em>the
    Gout and Bloody Flux.</em> And likewise the
    Fat of a Seal, mixt with Oyntment of Roses,
    is good <em>for Gouty persons.</em> And if one tie the
    Heart of it to the Mast of a Ship, <em>the Ship will
    never suffer Shipwrack.</em> And if you hang its
    Skin at the Sayl-yard or at the Mast of a
    Ship, <em>it will not be struck by Thunder.</em> And
    the Bird eaten cures Icterick Persons. And
    its Claws hung about one <em>cures the cold Fit

    of Fury above the Anger of ones Enemies,</em> especially
    if the hairs of a Seal be enclosed in
    it. <em>It preserves also from venomous Stings.</em> And
    it has other Acts also, which I shall relate.
    Take the Stone, which is called <em>Hieracite</em>
    and engrave in it a Hawk, and at his feet a
    Frog, and under foot engrave this <em>M l â a â</em>
    which is <em>Malaa</em>. In another Book it is found

    But other have it thus <em>M a a a a a</em>.
    And take a common Hawk, which we call
    <em>Circus</em>, or a Falcon, kill it in Spring-water
    by dipping it under water so often till it dies.
    Take it therefore, and preserve it in Myrrh
    for seven days, as in Salt. And after seven
    dayes, tie the Tongue of a living Frog, and two
    stones, <em>scil.</em> a <em>Hieracites</em> and a Magnet, and
    little filings of Steel, that the Magnet may
    live, tie them in a Hawk&#39;s Skin: And make
    the Ligature of the Phylactery of the nerve
    of the Hawk, as a round (or twisted) Cord
    small and long, that being worn about the
    Neck, it may reach to the Stomach and Heart
    and <em>you will foreknow all things</em>. But neither
    tell, nor teach this to thy own Son. <em>This
    the Apozeme or Cup of the Phylactery</em>. Take a
    new Flagon or Dish, in which the foresaid
    Water where the Bird was killed is, and take
    of that Water ℥ij. and of Honey ℥j. and of
    Rosemary root ℥ij. and of Barley first infused
    in Rain-water till it sprout, so that indeed

    of the Herb <em>Chamæleon</em> iiij Seeds,
    which are called <em>Cnidius Coccus</em>. Bruise them,
    and boyl then with <em>Hydromel</em>, till it grow as
    thick as an Electuary, and put it up in a
    Glass Vessel, and keep it covered. But when
    you put this up, put into it the heart of a
    Houp, and its Blood; and again upon this,
    swallow another heart of a Houp, and <em>Hydromel</em>
    after it, and a little of the Composition,
    <em>and you will be perfect all the time of your Life.</em>
    And it is good, if you dip the foresaid Stones
    in the same Composition, and so you will provide
    for your self when you want any thing,
    or you shall keep a Ring so, and you will be
    perfect. <em>When therefore you would foreknow, or

    a Pilchard or Herring. <a target="_blank" href="https://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BD%A0%CE%BA%CF%85%CF%84%CF%8C%CE%BA%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82">Ώκυτόκιος</a>,</em> i.e.
    <em>velociter pariens, quickly bearing, is a Stone less
    than the Eagle-stone and ratling. And it is
    smooth to the Touch.</em></p>
    <p>We know of the Plant Basil, and that is has
    great Effects. If any one chew this Herb fasting,
    and before he have washed, and shall
    set it in the open Air for seven nights, in which
    time the Sun may not see it, taking it away
    indeed by day, and by night exposing it to
    the open Air, he will find a Scorpion of seven
    knots and green. <em>If this stings any one,
    he will swell and die in three dayes.</em> And if
    you put it into water or wine, and give it any
    one to drink, all his Body will grow dry and
    leprous. For of this come incurable Ulcers.
    And if you bruise the same Scorpion with the
    seed of the herb <em>Scorpiona</em>, and make Pills,
    afterwards dry them and put them up in a
    Glass, and give them any one that is Epileptick,
    he will no longer be bart. And you
    must give it for seven dayes alike, three Pills
    fasting, in temperate wine. But if you give
    it to a healthy Man, he will grow Lunatick,
    and he will be incurable. And if you anoint
    <em>People in Tertian Agues</em> with the Juice of the
    herb Basil and Swallow&#39;s Dung, you will cure
    them. And if you give a Swallow&#39;s Feather,
    and Basil root, <em>to a Woman in travail to hold,
    she will presently bring forth without any harm.</em>
    If you put a Feather of the Bird in any Unguent,
    <em>you will have love and peace with all men.</em>
    And concerning the common Scorpion
    I will hide nothing, because of the Error of
    the Foolish. For there is an Error implanted
    in the Air. If therefore you put a common
    Scorpion into ℥vijβ. of Oyl in the wain of
    the Moon, and keep it by you, and anoint
    any ones back, and the palms of his hands,
    and the soles of his feet; but you must anoint
    the back from the top to the bottom,
    and the forehead, and the head before the
    hour of the Fit, <em>it will cure a Tertian, and a
    Quartan, and a Quotidian Ague. It also helps
    Lunaticks, and those that are possessed with the
    Devil.</em> But if you put a Feather of the Bird
    into other Oyl, and anoint him that is cured,
    his Disease will return, and he will die. And
    a common Scorpion roasted and eaten by
    those that have the Stone, <em>makes them piss the
    Stone without torment.</em> Tie up the string of a
    Scorpion, and the extremity of the Herb Basil,
    in which the Seed is, and a Swallow&#39;s heart
    in a Deer&#39;s skin, <em>and you will cure Lunaticks;
    and this Phylactery both casts out disobedient
    Devils, and compels them to go away.</em> And
    dissolve the foresaid Stone with the Juice of
    the Herb, and the blood of the Bird, and
    the head of a Herring, and a little water,
    and put it up in a Glass Vessel, and <em>when you
    have a mind to make shew of your power,</em> dip
    the fingers of your hand, either right
    or left, <em>and touch the strongest stone that you
    please, or bone, or wood, it will presently break,
    so that you shall seem great.</em> And if one puts
    the head of a fresh Herring upon the Coals
    to fumigate, and he gets upon the house in
    the night, he will think <em>that all the Stars run
    into one.</em> And if any one at the full Moon
    shall put the head of the Animal into a dry
    Fig, and shall lay it on the Fire, when the
    Air is still he will see the Orb of the Moon
    as big as half of Heaven. <em>Another sight;</em>
    And if you mix a little of the Sea-star with
    it, you see great <em>Stichius</em>, he is the <em>Dæmon
    Fortune</em>, made, and standing at your
    feet. And if you powder the Stone <em>Pyrites</em>,
    and in like manner lay it on, <em>there will be
    Thunder and Lightning.</em> And if you also lay

    be rid of his Disease. But if you make a
    Fomentation applies for one day, and would
    give any relief, it will do no good. But it
    will not pass seven dayes: for this is the Medicine
    of things that are applied. And <em>Mænis</em>
    is so called, because it makes a Maniacal
    Confection in this manner, Take, I say, the
    eyes of a <em>Mænis</em>, and put them into Wine
    with some Lily, and infuse them so for seven
    dayes, then put into the Wine of Mandrake
    Seeds ℥xiv. Seeds of <a target="_blank" href="https://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%85%CE%BD%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BD">κυνοσβάτε</a>, <em>i.e.</em> Dog-Briar

    People;</em> If you see any one in Madness, or a
    <em>Mania</em>, give him of the Wine ℥ij. with warm
    water, and he will be cured (in another Book
    it was ℥viij.) And if you mix it with an Eye-water,
    and make an infusion, and use it for
    seven dayes <em>in a suffusion of the Eyes,</em> it will
    cure. And the Stones, that are in the head
    of a <em>Mænis</em>, powdered and mixt with the
    gall of a black <em>Alanitus, make one to see these
    things that are in the dark.</em> And if you mix
    it with a little of living Magnet, and a little
    Rain-water, and anoint, <em>you will see these

    he cannot drink a more precious
    Liquor. Take therefore the Ring, and put
    it in Water, and give him to drink, and he
    will be safe; and if you give it before Madness,
    he will not be mad. And if one give
    the Tongue of a young <em>Mænis</em> dissolved in
    water, and putting the Ring into it, give it
    a mad man to drink, he will be safe. But if
    you give it to one that is sober, it will make
    him raging mad. His Relief is, to give him a
    roasted <em>Mænis</em> to eat, and the man will become
    ignorant of the foresaid things. <em>As
    Divine</em> Kiranides <em>sayes unto Men.</em></p>
    <p><em>Thus</em> Harpocration <em>finished this Book, and I
    found no other Book of them that are called</em>
    Kirandes. <em>But indeed in this, I say,</em> Harpocration
    <em>was dissonant from</em> Kirani, <em>or the
