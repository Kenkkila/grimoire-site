<div id="fulltext-content">
    <h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>In the first part is contained various dispositions of characters, by which powers the spirits or,
    rather, the devils are invoked, to make them come when you will, each according to his power,
    and to bring whatever is asked: and that without any discomfort, providing also that they are
    content on their part; for this sort of creature does not give anything for nothing. In the first
    part is taught the means of calling forth the Elemental Spirits of the <a href="/element/air">Air</a>,
    <a href="/element/earth">Earth</a>, <a href="/element/water-ingredient">Sea</a> or of the
    <a href="/element/fire">Infernus</a>, according to their affinities.</p>
    <p>In the second part are expressed the secrets, both Natural and Supernatural which operate by
    the power of the Daemons. You will find the manner to make use of them, and all without
    deceit.</p>
    <p>In the third part is the Key to the Work, with the manner of using it. But, before starting this, it
    will be necessary to be instructed in the following: There are three powers, which are <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a>,
    <a href="/demon/beelzebub">Beelzebuth</a> and <a href="/demon/astaroth">Astaroth</a>. You must engrave their Characters in the correct manner and at the
    appropriate hours. Believe me, all this is of consequence, nothing is to be forgotten.</p>
    <h2 id="the-first-book">THE FIRST BOOK</h2>
    <h3 id="concerning-the-characters-of-the-daemons">Concerning the Characters of the Daemons.</h3>
    <p>You must carry the aforesaid character with you. If you are male, in the right pocket, and it is
    to be written in your own <a href="/ingredient/human-blood">blood</a>, or that of a sea-turtle. You put at the two half-circles the first
    letter of your name and surname. And if you wish more, you may draw the character on an
    emerald or ruby, for they have a sympathy for the spirits, especially those of the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a>, who are
    the most knowledgeable, and are better than the others. If you are a female, carry the character
    on the left side, between the breasts, like a Reliquary; and always observing, as much as the
    other sex, to write or have engraved the character on the day and in the hour of <a href="/astrological_body/mars">Mars</a>. Obey the
    spirits in this, that they may obey thee.</p>
    <p>The spirits who are powerful and exalted, serve only their confidants and intimate friends, by
    the pact made or to be made according to certain characters at the will of Singambuth or of his
    Secretary. Aabidandes, of whom we will give you information, is the perfect acquaintance to
    call, conjure and constrain, as you will see in the Key, where you will be given a method of
    making a pact with the spirits.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-nature-of-pacts">Of the Nature of Pacts.</h3>
    <p>There are only two kinds of pact, the tacit and the apparent [or explicit]. You will know the one
    from the other, if you read this little book. Know, however, that there are many kinds of spirits,
    some attractive and others not attractive.</p>
    <p>It is when you make a pact with a spirit, and have to give the spirit something which belongs to
    you, that you have to be on your guard.</p>
    <h3 id="the-kinds-of-spirits">The Kinds of Spirits.</h3>
    <p>In regard to spirits, there are the superior and the inferior. Names of the superiors are: <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a>,
    <a href="/demon/beelzebub">Beelzebuth</a>, <a href="/demon/astaroth">Astaroth</a>. The inferiors of <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a> are in Europe and Asia, and obey him.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/beelzebub">Beelzebuth</a> lives in Africa, and <a href="/demon/astaroth">Astaroth</a> inhabits America.</p>
    <p>Of these, each of them has two who order their subjects all that which the Emperor has
    resolved to do in all the world, and vice-versa.</p>
    <h3 id="the-visible-appearance-of-spirits">The Visible Appearance of Spirits.</h3>
    <p>Spirits do not always appear in the same shape. This is because they are not themselves of
    matter or form, and have to find a body to appear in, and one suitable to their intended
    manifestation and appearance.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a> appears in the form and figure of a fair boy. When angry, he seems red. There is
    nothing monstrous about him.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/beelzebub">Beelzebuth</a> appears sometimes in monstrous forms, sometimes like a giant cow, at times like a
    he-<a href="/creature/goat">goat</a>, with a long tail. When angry, he vomits fire.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/astaroth">Astaroth</a> appears black, in human shape.</p>
    <p>Here are three characters of <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a>, outside his circle:
    The following are those of <a href="/demon/beelzebub">Beelzebuth</a> and <a href="/demon/astaroth">Astaroth</a> placed outside their circles:</p>
    <h3 id="to-invoke-the-spirits">To Invoke the Spirits.</h3>
    <p>It is only necessary, when you desire to invoke them, to call them by their characters, which
    they themselves have given. And when you wish to invoke them, call them to serve you, in the
    manner taught in the Third Part.</p>
    <h3 id="descending-to-the-inferiors">Descending to the Inferiors.</h3>
    <p><a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a> has two demons under him: <a href="/demon/satanakia">Satanackia</a> and <a href="/demon/agalierap">Agalierap</a>. Those of <a href="/demon/beelzebub">Beelzebuth</a> are
    Tarchimache and <a href="/demon/fleurety">Fleruty</a>. The characters of <a href="/demon/satanakia">Satanackia</a> and <a href="/demon/fleurety">Fleruty</a> are:</p>
    <p>[figure]</p>
    <p>The two inferiors of <a href="/demon/astaroth">Astaroth</a> are <a href="/demon/sagatana">Sagatana</a> and <a href="/demon/nesbiros">Nesbiros</a>, and their characters are:
    There are yet other daemons, apart from these, who are under Duke <a href="/demon/syrach">Syrach</a>. There are eighteen
    of these, and their names are:</p>
    <p>I. <a href="/demon/clauneck">Clauneck</a><br>II. <a href="/demon/musisin">Musisin</a><br>III. <a href="/demon/bechaud">Bechaud</a><br>IV. <a href="/demon/nambroth">Frimost</a><br>V. <a href="/demon/klepoth">Klepoth</a><br>VI. <a href="/demon/khil">Khil</a><br>VII. <a href="/demon/[merfilde](/demon/merfilde">Mersilde</a>)<br>VIII. <a href="/demon/[clistheret](/demon/clistheret">Clisthert</a>)<br>IX. <a href="/demon/[acham](/demon/acham">Sirchade</a>)<br>X. <a href="/demon/segal">Segal</a><br>XI. <a href="/demon/hicpacth">Hicpacth</a><br>XII. <a href="/demon/humots">Humots</a><br>XIII. <a href="/demon/frucissiere">Frucissiere</a><br>XIV. <a href="/demon/guland">Guland</a><br>XV. <a href="/demon/surgat">Surgat</a><br>XVI. <a href="/demon/morail">Morail</a><br>XVII. <a href="/demon/frutimiere">Frutimiere</a><br>XVIII. <a href="/demon/huictiigaras">Huictiigaras</a>  </p>

    <p>AGLA <em> ADONAY </em> JEHOVA</p>
    <p>There are other daemons, but as they have no power, we shall not speak of them. The powers
    of the eighteen above-mentioned ones are these:</p>
    <p><strong><a href="/demon/clauneck">CLAUNECK</a></strong> has power over riches, can cause treasures to be found. He can give great riches to he who makes a pact with him, for he is much loved by <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a>. It is he who causes money to be brought.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="/demon/frucissiere">FRUCISSIERE</a></strong> revives the dead.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="/demon/guland">GULAND</a></strong> causes all illnesses.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="/demon/surgat">SURGAT</a></strong> opens every kind of lock.</p>

    <p>Under <a href="/demon/satanakia">Satanachia</a> and Sataniciae are fourty-five [or, according to other versions, fifty-four]
    daemons. Four of these, the chiefs, are <a href="/demon/sergutthy">Sergutthy</a>, <a href="/demon/heramael">Heramael</a>, <a href="/demon/trimasel">Trimasael</a> and <a href="/demon/sustugriel">Sustugriel</a>. The
    others are of no great consequence.</p>
    <p>These spirits are of great advantage, and they work well and speedily, in the case that they are
    pleased with the operator.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/sergutthy">Sergutthy</a> has power over maidens and wives, when things are favourable.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/heramael">Heramael</a> teaches the art of healing, including the complete knowledge of any illness and its

    with water.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/nesbiros">Nebirots</a> rules <a href="/demon/hael">Hael</a> and <a href="/demon/sergulath">Surgulath</a>. The former (Hael) enables anyone to speak in any language he will, and also teches the means whereby any type of letter may be written. He is also able to
    teach those things which are most secret and completely hidden.</p>
    <p><a href="/demon/sergulath">Sergulath</a> gives every means of speculation. In addition, he instructs as to the methods of
    breaking the ranks and strategy of opponents. Subject to these are the eight most powerful
    subordinates:</p>

    <p>VIII. <a href="/demon/bucons">BUCON</a>, can cause hate and spiteful jealousy between members of the opposite sexes.</p>
    <h2 id="the-third-book">THE THIRD BOOK</h2>
    <p>The Invocation.</p>
    <p>This is the Invocation:
    HELOY + TAU + VARAF + PANTHON + HOMNORCUM + ELEMIATH +
    SERUGEATH + AGLA + ON + TETRAGRAMMATON + CASILY.</p>
    <p>This Invocation is to be made on virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>, with the characters of the Demon upon it,
    which causes the intermediary Scirlin to come. For from this depend all the others, and it can
    constrain them to appear in spite of themselves, as he has the power of Emperor.</p>
    <h3 id="orison-preparation">Orison : Preparation.</h3>
    <p>Lord God Adonay, who hast made man in Thine own image and resemblance out of nothing! I,
    poor sinner that I am, beg Thee to deign bless and sanctify this water, so that it may be healthy
    for my body and my soul, and that all foolishness should depart from it.</p>
    <p>Lord God, all-powerful and ineffable, and who led Thy people out of the land of Egypt, and
    has enabled them to cross the Red Sea with dry feet! Accord me this, that I may be purified by
    this water of all my sins, so that I may appear innocent before Thee! Amen.</p>
    <p>When the operator has thus purified himself, he is to set about the making of the Instruments of the Art.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-magical-knife">Of the Magical Knife.</h3>
    <p>It is necessary to have a <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a> or lancet, of new <a href="/metal/steel">steel</a>, made on the day and hour of <a href="/astrological_body/jupiter">Jupiter</a> with
    the <a href="/astrological_body/moon">Moon</a> crescent. If it cannot be made, it may be bought, but this must be done at the time, as
    above.</p>
    <p>Having achieved this, you will say the Orison or Conjuration following, which will serve for
    the knife and lancet.</p>
    <h3 id="conjuration-of-the-instrument">Conjuration of the Instrument.</h3>
    <p>I conjure thee, O form of the Instrument, by the authority of our Father God Almighty, by the
    virtues of Heaven and by the Stars, by the virtue of the Angels, and by the virtue of the
    Elements, by the virtues of the stones and herbs, and of snow-storms, winds and thunder: that
    thou now obtain all the necessary power into thyself for the pefectioning of the achievement of
    those things in which we are at present concerned! And this without deception, untruth, or
    anything of that nature whatsoever, by God the Creator of the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a> of Angels! Amen.</p>
    <p>Then we recite the Seven Psalms, and afterwards the following words:</p>
    <p>Dalmaley lamekh cadat pancia velous merroe lamideck caldurech anereton mitraton : Most
    Pure Angels, be the guardians of these instruments, they are needed for many things.</p>
    <h3 id="the-sacrificial-knife">The Sacrificial Knife.</h3>
    <p>On the day of <a href="/astrological_body/mars">Mars</a> [<a href="/day_of_the_week/tuesday">Tuesday</a>] at the New <a href="/astrological_body/moon">Moon</a>, make a <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a> of new <a href="/metal/steel">steel</a> which is strong
    enough to cut the neck of a kid with one blow, and make a handle of wood on the same day and
    in the same hour, and with an engraver you engrave on the handle these characters:
    Then asperge and fumigate it, and you have prepared an instrument for service when and where
    you wish.</p>
    <h3 id="the-manner-of-asperging-amp-fumigation">The Manner of Asperging &amp; Fumigation.</h3>
    <p>First, there is the Orison which is needful on asperging, and it is thus recited:
    In the name of the immortal God, asperge [N] and clean you of all foolishness and all deceit,
    and you will be whiter than snow. Amen.</p>
    <p>Then pour as the aspersion blessed water thereon, saying:
    In the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost, Amen.</p>
    <p>These aspersions are necessary for every item of equipment; so also is the fumigation which
    follows.</p>
    <p>To fumigate, it is necessary to have a cruse, in which you place <a href="/ingredient/coal">coal</a> newly kindled with a new
    fire, and let it be well ablaze. On this you place aromatics, and when perfuming the article in
    question, say the following:</p>
    <p>Angels of God, be our help, and may our work be accomplished by you. Zalay, Salmay,
    Dalmay, Angrecton, Ledrion, Amisor, Euchey, Or. Great Angels: And do thou also, O Adonay,
    come and give to this a virtue so that this creature may gain a shape, and by this let our work
    be accomplished. In the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost, Amen.</p>
    <p>Then recite the Seven Psalms which come after Judicum tuum Regida and Laudate Dominum
    omnes gentes.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-virgin-parchment">Of the Virgin Parchment.</h3>
    <p>Virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a> can be made in many ways. Generally it is made of the skin of a <a href="/creature/goat">goat</a> or a
    lamb, or other animal, which must be virgin.</p>
    <p>After inscribing on the blade AGLA, and having fumigated it, the <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a> will serve you for all
    purposes.</p>
    <p>Remember that when you make the Sacrifice in order to obtain the virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a> from the
    kid, all the instruments must be on the altar.</p>
    <p>You make the baton [or Rod, staff] of the Art from <a href="/plant/hazel-tree">Hazel</a> wood that has never borne, and cut it
    with a single stoke on the day and in the hour of <a href="/astrological_body/mercury">Mercury</a> [<a href="/day_of_the_week/wednesday">Wednesday</a>], at the Crescent <a href="/astrological_body/moon">Moon</a>.</p>
    <p>And you engrave it with the <a href="/ingredient/needle">needle</a>, the pen or the lancet, in the following characters:
    The seal and character of <a href="/demon/nambroth">Frimost</a> to be inscribed on the first Rod:
    Then you make another baton of <a href="/plant/hazel-tree">Hazel</a> wood, which has never borne, and which is without
    seed, and cut it in the day and hour of the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a> [<a href="/day_of_the_week/sunday">Sunday</a>], and on this you engrave these
    characters:</p>
    <p>The seal and character of <a href="/demon/klepoth">Klippoth</a> is to be inscribed on the second Rod.</p>
    <p>[figure]</p>
    <p>This having been done, you say over your baton the following Orison:
    Orison.</p>
    <p>Most wise, most powerful Adonay, deign to bless, sanctify and conserve this batton so that it
    may have the necessary virtue, O most holy Adonay, to whom be honor and glory for all time.</p>
    <p>Amen.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-lancet">Of the Lancet.</h3>
    <p>It is necessary to have a new lancet, conjured and prepared like the <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a> and sickle. Make it in
    the day and hour of <a href="/astrological_body/mercury">Mercury</a>, at the Crescent <a href="/astrological_body/moon">Moon</a>. Now follows the method of Making the
    Sacrifice of the Kid.</p>
    <p>Take your <a href="/creature/goat">goat</a> and place it on a flat surface, so that the throat is uppermost, the better to cut
    it. Take your <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a> and cut the throat with a single stroke, while pronouncing the name of the
    Spirit you wish to invoke.</p>
    <p>For example, you say:<br>I kill you in the name and in the honor of [N]. . .</p>
    <p>This is to be well understood, and take care that you sever the throat at first, and do not take
    two strokes, but see that he dies at the first.</p>
    <p>Then you skin him with the <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a>, and at the skinning make this Invocation:<br>Adonay, Dalmay, Lauday, Tetragrammaton, Anereton, and all you, Holy Angels of God, come
    and be here, and deign to infuse into this skin the power that it may be correctly conserved, so
    that all that is written upon it may become perfected.</p>
    <p>After the skinning, take well-ground <a href="/ingredient/salt">salt</a>, and strew this upon the skin, which has been
    stretched, and let the salt cover the skin well. Before you use the salt it must have the following
    Benediction said over it.</p>
    <h3 id="the-benediction-of-the-salt">The Benediction of the Salt.</h3>
    <p>I exorcise you, O creature of the <a href="/ingredient/salt">Salt</a>, by the God who is living, the God of all Gods, the Lord
    of all Lords, that all fantasies may leave you, and that you may be suitable for the virgin
    <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>.</p>
    <p>When this is finished, let the skin with the <a href="/ingredient/salt">salt</a> upon it remain in the sun for a full day. Then
    obtain a glazed pottery jar, and write these characters around it with the Pen of the Art:</p>
    <p>[figure]</p>
    <p>Get <a href="/ingredient/lime-chemical">quicklime</a> and slake this with exorcised water, and put these in the jar. Whe it is liquid
    place it in your goatskin, and leave it long enough for the hairs to peel off of themselves.</p>
    <p>As soon as the hair is in such a condition as to come off with a touch, remove it from the jar
    and peel the hairs with a <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a> made from carved <a href="/plant/hazel-tree">Hazel</a>. The knife must have had these words said over it:</p>
    <p>O holiest Adonay, put into this wood the power to cleanse this skin, through the holy name
    Agason, Amen.</p>
    <p>The skin, when peeled, may be stretched over a piece of new wood, and stones are to be placed
    on the skin, so that they hold it down. These are to be stones from a river bank. Before placing
    the stones, say the following Orison over them.</p>
    <h3 id="the-orison-of-the-stones">The Orison of the Stones.</h3>
    <p>O Adonay, most puissant and all-powerful Lord, allow that these stones may stretch this skin,
    and remove from them all wickedness, so that they may possess the required power. Amen.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-aspersion-of-the-water">Of the Aspersion of the Water.</h3>
    <p>All water used in these experiments must be asperged, by saying this over it:</p>
    <p>Lord God, Father, all-powerful, my refuge and my life, help me, Holy Father, for I love you,
    God of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of the Archangels and Prophets, Creator of All. In
    humility, and, calling upon Thy holy Name, I supplicate that thou wilt agree to bless this water,
    so that it may sanctify our bodies and our souls, through Thee, most holy Adonay, Everlasting
    Ruler, Amen.</p>
    <p>The skin is allowed to dry after this, and before quitting the spot, say over the <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>:
    Je, Agla, Jod, Hoi, He, Emmanuel! Stand guard over this parchment, in order that no spectra
    may take charge of it!</p>
    <p>When the skin is dry it may be removed from its wodden frame, blessed and fumigated, and then it is ready for use.</p>
    <p>It is important that this must not be seen by any women, and more especially during certain
    times of theirs [i.e., during menstruation], otherwise it will lose its power. It must also be
    known that when you make and use this parchment, you must be clean, pure and chaste.</p>
    <p>The operator is to say one Mass of the Nativity then, and all the instruments are to be on the
    altar.</p>
    <h3 id="of-aspersion">Of Aspersion.</h3>
    <p>You take an asperser made with a bunch of mint, <a href="/plant/marjoram">marjoram</a> and <a href="/plant/rosemary">rosemary</a> which is secured by
    a <a href="/ingredient/thread">thread</a> which has been made by a virgin maiden.</p>
    <p>The asperger is made in the day and hour of <a href="/astrological_body/mercury">Mercury</a> when the <a href="/astrological_body/moon">Moon</a> is at its crescent.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-perfumes">Of the Perfumes.</h3>
    <p>These are to be wood of aloes, <a href="/ingredient/incense">incense</a> and <a href="/plant/mace">mace</a>. As for the mace, this is all that you need for the circle, and over the perfumes is to be said the following Orison:</p>
    <h3 id="the-orison-of-the-aromatic-perfumes">The Orison of the Aromatic Perfumes.</h3>
    <p>Deign, O Lord, to sanctify the creature of this, in order that it may be a remedy for the human
    race, and that it may be a remedy for our souls and bodies, through the invoking of Thy holy
    Name! Agree that all creatures which may breathe in the vapor of this may have wealth of their
    bodies and souls: through the Lord who has fashioned the time eternal! Amen.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-pen-of-the-art">Of the Pen of the Art.</h3>
    <p>Take a new quill, and asperge and fumigate this in the same way as the other instruments, and
    when you are cutting its points, say:
    Ababaloy, Samoy, Escavor, Adonay: I have from this quill driven out all illusions, so that it
    may hold within it with effectiveness the power needed for all those things which are used in
    the Art: for both the operations and the characters and conjurations. Amen.</p>
    <h3 id="of-the-ink-horn">Of the Ink-horn.</h3>
    <p>You buy a new Ink-horn on the day and in the hour of <a href="/astrological_body/mercury">Mercury</a>. At this time, also, these
    characters are [to be] inscribed upon it:</p>
    <p>JOD HE VAU HE + <a href="/angel/metatron">METATRON</a> + JOD + KADOS + ELOHIM <a href="/angel/sabaoth">SABAOTH</a>.</p>
    <p>Then newly-made ink is exorcised with this exorcism before being placed in the horn:
    I exorcise you, Creature of this Ink, by the names Anston, Cerreton, Stimulator, Adonay, and
    by the Name of He who created all by one word, and who can achieve all, so that you shall
    assist me in my work, and so this work may be accomplished by my desire, and brought to a
    successful end through the agreement of God, He who rules all things, and through all things,
    omnipresent and eternal. Amen.</p>
    <h3 id="then-the-ink-is-to-be-blessed-with-this-blessing">Then the ink is to be blessed with this Blessing:</h3>
    <p>Lord God, Almighty, ruler over all and forever, Thou who dost cause to take place the greatest
    wonders in Thy creations, deign to grant the grace of Thy holy spirit through this ink. Bless it,
    and sanctify it, and impart to it a special power, that whatever we may say or do or desire may
    be accomplished: through Thee, Most Holy Prince, ADONAY. Amen.</p>
    <h3 id="the-preperation-of-the-operator">The Preperation of the Operator.</h3>
    <p>When the implements are ready, the operator must prepare himself. This is first done by this Preparatory Orison:</p>
    <p>Lord God, ADONAY, who hast formed man in Thine image, I, the unworthy and sinful,
    beseech Thee to sanctify this water, to benefit my body and soul, cause me to be cleansed.</p>
    <p>As he says this the operator is to wash his face and hands with the water that he is blessing.</p>
    <p>NOTE: This water is to be used for washing the hands and feet, and know also and know and
    know again that it is necessary and most necessary, to abstain three days from sin: and above
    all mortally, however much the human frailty may be, and especially guard your chastity.</p>
    <p>During the three days, study the book and during this time, pray five times during the day and
    four times each night, with the following form:</p>
    <p>Astrachios, Asach, Ascala, Abedumabal, Silat, Anabotas, Jesubilin, Scingin, Geneon, Domol:<br>O Lord my God, Thou who art seated higher than the Heavens, Thou who art seated higher
    than the Heavens, Thou who seeth even unto the depths, I pray that Thou unto me the things
    which I have in my mind and that I may be successful in them: through Thee, O Great God, the
    Eternal and who reigns for ever and ever. Amen. [Shah gives a note of a variation: &quot;Astrocio,
    Asath, a sacra Bedrimubal, Felut, Anabotos, Serabilem, Sergen, Gemen, Domos: . . .&quot;]</p>
    <p>All this having been done correctly, all that remains is to follow your invocations and draw
    your characters and you do as follows.</p>
    <p>In the day and hour of <a href="/astrological_body/mars">Mars</a> [<a href="/day_of_the_week/tuesday">Tuesday</a>] the <a href="/astrological_body/moon">Moon</a> being at the crescent, and at the first hour of
    the day—which is a quarter of an hour before sunrise—you will prepare a piece of virgin
    <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>, which shall contain all the characters and the invocations of the spirits which you
    wish to produce.</p>
    <p>For example, in the said day and hour, you will attach to the small finger of the hand (which is
    the finger of <a href="/astrological_body/mercury">Mercury</a> a <a href="/ingredient/thread">thread</a> spun by a virgin girl, and pierce the finger with the lancet of the
    Art, to get <a href="/ingredient/human-blood">blood</a> from it, with which you form your Scirlin character, as is given at the
    commencement of this book. Then write your invocation, which is that which follows.</p>
    <h3 id="invocation-to-scirlin">Invocation to Scirlin.</h3>
    <p>HELON + TAUL + VARF + PAN + HEON + HOMONOREUM + CLEMIALH +
    SERUGEATH + AGLA + TETRAGRAMMATON + CASOLY.</p>
    <p>You must write the first letter of your name where is the letter A [in the sign &amp; character of
    Scirlin], and that of your surname where is the letter D. The spirit Aglassis, whose character it
    is, is very potent to render you service, and will cause you to have power over the other spirits.</p>
    <p>Make above the Character of the Spirit that you desire to come, and burn <a href="/ingredient/incense">incense</a> in his honor.</p>
    <p>Then make the conjuration which is addressed to the spirit that you want to cause to appear,
    and burn incense in his honor.</p>
    <h3 id="conjuration-for-lucifer-demon-lucifer">Conjuration for <a href="/demon/lucifer">Lucifer</a>.</h3>

    Chenibranbo Calevodium, Brazo Tabrasol, Come, Astaroth, Amen.</p>
    <p>After having said seven times the conjuration addressed to superior spirits, you will see the
    spirit at once appear, to do whatever you desire.</p>
    <h3 id="dismissal-of-the-spirit">Dismissal of the Spirit.</h3>
    <p>When you have written the conjuration on the virgin parchment, and have seen the spirit, being
    satisfied, you can dismiss him by saying this:</p>
    <p>Ite in pace ad loca vestra et pax sit inter vos redituri ad mecum vos invocavero, in nomine
    Patris + et Filii + et Spiritus Sancti + Amen.</p>
    <p>[Go in peace unto your abode and let there be peace between you and I, and be ready to come

    <p>Immortal, eternal, ineffable and Holy Father of all things, who is carried by the revolving
    chariot unceasingly, of the worlds which continually revolve: dominator of the Etherian
    countries where there is raised the throne of Thy power: above which Thy redoubtable eyes see
    all, and Thy holy ears hear allÑaid Thy children whom Thou hast loved since the birth of the
    centuries: for thy golden and great and eternal majesty shines above the world, the sky and the
    stars, Thou art elevated above all, O sparkling fire, and Thou illuminatest Thyself by Thy
    splendor, and there go out from Thy essence untarnishable rays of light which nourish Thy
    infinite spirit. That infinite spirit produces all things, and makes the mighty treasure which
    cannot fail, to the creation which surrounds Thee, due to the numberless forms of which she
    bears, and which Thou hast filled at the start. From this spirit comes also the origin of those
    most holy kings who are around Thy throne, and who compose Thy court, O Universal Father!
    O Unique One, O Father of happy mortals and immortals! Thou hast created in particular the
    powers which are marvellously like the eternal thought, and from Thy adorable essence. Thou
    hast established them over the angels, Thou hast created a third kind of sovereign in the
    elements. Our cintinual exercise is to worship Thy desires. We burn with the desire to possess
    Thee, O Father, O Mother, the most tender of Mothers! O wonderful example of feelings and

    <h3 id="of-the-pentacle-and-the-manner-of-working">Of the Pentacle and the Manner of Working.</h3>
    <p>I have put here the form of the <a href="/magic_object/pentagram-of-solomon">Pentacle of Solomon</a> so that you may make the arrangements,
    they being of great importance.</p>
    <p>When you make your circle, before entering therein, it is to be perfumed with <a href="/ingredient/musk">musk</a>, <a href="/ingredient/amber">amber</a>,
    aloes wood and <a href="/ingredient/incense">incense</a>. And for the perfume which you will need for the invocations, that is
    incense alone.</p>
    <p>It is to be observed that you need to have always a fire during invocations, and when you
    perfume, this will be in the name of the spirit that you would invoke. When you are placing the
    perfume on the fire, say all the time:</p>
    <p>I burn this, N., in the name and to the honor of N.</p>
    <p>It is to be remembered that you must hold the invocation in the left hand, and in the right a rod
    of <a href="/plant/[elder-leaves](/plant/elder-leaves">elder</a>), and a ladle and a <a href="/ingredient/knife">knife</a> are to be at your feet.</p>
    <p>When all this is ready, stand inside the circle. If you have companions with you, they are to
    hold a hand one of the other. When inside, trace the form of the circle with the knife of the Art.</p>
    <p>Then pick up the wands, one after the other, reciting the Fiftieth Psalm. When the circle is
    complete, perfume and sprinkle it with <a href="/ingredient/holy-water">holy water</a>. Characters are to written at the four corners of the circle. There are generally four pentacles, one at each point of the compass; and the
    spirit is prohibited specifically from entering into the precincts of the circle.</p>
    <p>Then the invocations are to be repeated seven times. When the spirit appears, make him sign
    the character which you are holding in your hand, which promises that he will come whenever
    you may call him. Ask for what you think needed, and he will give it to you.</p>
    <h3 id="dismissal-of-the-spirit">Dismissal of the Spirit.</h3>
    <p>Let him go away in these words:
    Ite in pace ad loca vestra et pax sit inter vos redituri ad mecum vos invocavero, in nomine

    <p>[Go in peace unto your abode and let there be peace between you and I, and be ready to come

    <p>In the name of the Lord, Amen. YE shall see in this mirror anything which you may desire. In
    the name of the Lord who is blessed, in the name of the Lord, Amen. Firstly, you shall abstain
    from all actions of the flesh, and also from any sin, whether in word or action, during the
    period of time laid down herein. Secondly, you must perform acts of good and piety. Thirdly,
    take a plate of finest <a href="/metal/steel">steel</a>, burnished and slightly curved, and with the blood of a white <a href="/creature/pigeon">pigeon</a>
    write upon it, at the four corners, these names: JEHOVA, ELOYM, <a href="/[angel](/angelic_order/angel">METATRON</a>/metatron), ADONAY.</p>

    art, and who shall ever be, so that in Thy name they may work and act with equity, giving me
    knowledge in everything that I shall seek to know of them.</p>
    <p>Now you are to throw down upon the burning embers a perfume. While you are doing this, say:

    This is to be said three times. When you have done so, breathe three times upon the surface of

    <p>Come, <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>, in the terrific name of Jehova! Come, <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>, by the power of the everliving
    Elohim! Come, thee, by the right arm of the mighty <a href="/angel/metatron">Metatron</a>!</p>
    <p>Come to me, N., and order thy subjects so that they may make known to me through their love,
    joy and peace, the things that are hidden from my eyes.</p>
    <p>When you have finished this, raise your eyes toward Heaven and say:
    O most powerful Lord, who does cause all things to move in accordance with Thy will, listen to
    my prayer, and may my intentions be aggreeable to Thee! O Lord, if it be Thy will, deign to
    gaze upon this mirror and sanctify it, that Thy Servant <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a> may come thereto with his
    companions, and be agreeable to me, N., Thy poor and humble servant! O God, blessed and
    raised above all the spirits of Heaven, Thou who livest and reignest for all time. Amen.</p>
    <p>When this is done, make the Sign of the Cross over yourself, and also on the mirror on the first
    day, and also on the next forty and five days. At the end of this time, the angel <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a> will
    appear to you, like unto a beautiful <a href="/creature/child">child</a>. He will greet you, and will order his companions to
    obey you.</p>
    <p>It does not always require as long as this to cause the <a href="/angelic_order/angel">angel</a> to appear, however. He may come
    on the fourteenth day, but this will depend upon the degree of application and fervor of the
    operator.</p>
    <p>When he comes, ask him whatever you may desire, and also beg him to come and do your will
    whenever you shall call him.</p>
    <p>When you want <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a> to come again, after the first time, all you have to do is to perfume the
    <a href="/ingredient/mirror">mirror</a>, and say these words: Come, <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>, come, and let it be thy agreement --and the rest of
    this prayer to <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a> as we have given you above, until the Amen.</p>
    <h5 id="dismissing-the-spirit">Dismissing the Spirit.</h5>
    <p>When he has answered your questions, and you are satisfied with him, you must send him away
    by saying this:<br>I thank thee, <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a>, for having appeared and having fulfilled my requests. Thou mayest
    therefore depart in peace, and shall return when I call unto thee.</p>
    <p>The perfume of <a href="/angel/anael">Anael</a> is <a href="/plant/saffron">saffron</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="divination-by-the-word-of-uriel-angel-uriel">Divination by the Word of <a href="/angel/uriel">Uriel</a>.</h4>
    <p>To succeed in this operation, he who makes the experiment must do all things which are told
    herein. He is to choose a small room or place which for nine days or more has not been visited
    by women in an impure state [i.e., during their menstration period].</p>
    <p>This place must be well cleaned and consecrated, by means of consecrations and aspersions. In
    the middle of the room there is to be a table covered with a white <a href="/ingredient/cloth">cloth</a>. On this is a new glass
    vial full of spring water, brought shortly before the operation, with three small tapers of virgin
    <a href="/ingredient/wax-ingredient">wax</a> mixed with human fat; a piece of virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>, and the quill of a <a href="/creature/raven">raven</a> suitable for
    writing with; an inkpot of chine full of fresh ink; a small container of metal with materials to
    make a fire.</p>
    <p>You must also find a boy of nine or ten years old, who shall be well behaved and cleanly
    dressed. He should be near the table.</p>
    <p>A large new <a href="/ingredient/needle">needle</a> is taken, and one of the three tapers is mounted upon it, six inches behind
    the glass. The other two tapers should be positioned at the right and left of the glass, and an
    equal distance away.</p>
    <p>While you are doing this, say:</p>
    <p>Gabamiah, Adonay, Agla, O Lord of Powers, aid us!</p>
    <p>Place the virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a> on the right of the glass and the pen and ink on the left. Before
    starting, close the door and windows.</p>
    <p>Now stir the fire, and light the wax tapers. Let the boy be on his knees, looking into the glass
    vial. He should be bareheaded and his hands joined.</p>
    <p>Now the Master orders the boy to stare fixedly into the vial, and speaking softly into his right
    ear, he says:</p>
    <h5 id="the-conjuration">The Conjuration.</h5>
    <p><a href="/angel/uriel">URIEL</a> + SERAPH + JOSATA + ABLATI + AGLA + CAILA, I beg and conjure thee by the
    four words that God spoke with His mouth to His servant Moses: JOSTA + AGLA + CAILA</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ABLATI. And by the name of the Nine Heavens in which thou livest, and also by the
    virginity of this <a href="/creature/child">child</a> who is before thee, to appear at once, and visibly, to reveal that truth
    which I desire to know. And when this is done, I shall discharge thee in peace and benevolence,
    in the Name of the Most Holy Adonay.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When this conjuration is finished, ask the <a href="/creature/child">child</a> whether he sees anything in the vial. If he
    answers that he sees an <a href="/angelic_order/angel">angel</a> or other materialization, the Master of the operation shall say in a
    friendly tone:</p>
    <p>Blessed spirit, welcome. I conjure thee again, in the Name of the Most Holy Adonay, to reveal
    to me immediately . . . . (Here the operator petitions the spirit for what he will.)</p>
    <p>Then say to the spirit:</p>
    <p>If, for any reason, thou dost not wish what thou sayest to be heard by others, I conjure thee to
    write the answer upon this virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>, between this time and the morrow. Otherwise
    thou mayst reveal it to me in my sleep.</p>
    <p>If the spirit answers audibly, you must listen with respect. If he does not speak, after you have
    repeated the supplication three times, snuff the tapers, and leave the room until the following
    day. Return the next morning, and you will find the answer written on the virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>, if
    it has not been revealed to you in the night.</p>
    <h4 id="divination-by-the-egg-spell-divination-by-egg"><a href="/spell/divination-by-egg">Divination by the Egg.</a></h4>
    <p>The operation of the <a href="/ingredient/eggs">Egg</a> is to know what will happen to anyone who is present at the
    experiment.</p>
    <p>One takes an <a href="/ingredient/eggs">egg</a> of a black <a href="/ingredient/hen">hen</a>, laid in the daytime, breaks it, and removes the germ.</p>
    <p>You must have a large glass, very thin and clear. Fill this with clear water and into it put the
    egg-germ.</p>
    <p>The glass is placed in the <a href="/astrological_body/sun">Sun</a> at midday in <a href="/season/summer">summer</a>, and the Director of the operation will
    recite the prayers and conjurations of the day.</p>
    <p>These prayers and conjurations are such as are found in the <a href="/grimoire/clavicula-salomonis">Key of Solomon</a>, in which we treat
    amply of airy spirits.</p>
    <p>And with the index finger, agitate the water, to make the germ turn. Leave it to rest a moment,
    and then look at it through the glass, not touching it. Then you will see the answer, and it
    should be tried on a working-day, because these are spirits that will come during the times of
    ordinary occupations.</p>
    <p>If one wishes to see if a boy or a girl is a virgin, the germ will fall to the bottom; and if he (or
    she) is not, it will be as usual.</p>
    <h4 id="to-see-spirits-of-the-air-spell-to-see-spirits"><a href="/spell/to-see-spirits">To See Spirits of the Air.</a></h4>
    <p>Take the brain of a <a href="/ingredient/rooster-1">cock</a>, the <a href="/ingredient/grave-earth/">powder from the grave of a dead man</a> (which touches the coffin),

    which is written the words:</p>
    <p>GOMERT KAILOETH, with the character of <a href="/demon/khil">Khil</a>.</p>
    <p>Burn it all, and you will see prodigious things. But this experiment should be done only by
    those who fear nothing.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to be three days chaste, and you will be elevated.</p>
    <p>I. Preparation. On the fourth day, as soon as it is morning, clean and prepare your room, as
    soon as you have dressed. You must be fasting at this time. Make sure that your room will not
    be disturbed for the whole of the ensuing day. Note that there shall be nothing hanging, neither
    anything crosswise to anything else, no tapestries or clothes hanging, and no hats or cages of
    birds, or curtains of the bed, and so on.</p>
    <p>Above all, make sure that everything is clean in every way.</p>
    <p>II. Ceremony. After you have supped, go secretly to your room, which has been cleansed as
    already described. Upon the table there is now to be set a white <a href="/ingredient/cloth">cloth</a>, and three chairs at the
    table. In front of each place, set a wheaten roll and a glass of clear and fresh water. Now place
    a chair at the side of the bed, and retire, while saying this:</p>
    <p>III. Conjuration. Besticitum consolatio veni ad me vertat Creon, Creon, Creon, cantor laudem
    omnipotentis et non commentur. Stat superior carta bient laudem omviestra principiem da
    montem et inimicos meos o prostantis vobis et mihi dantes que passium fieri sincisibus.</p>
    <p>The three people, having arrived, will sit by the fire, eating and drinking, and will thank the
    person who has entertained them. If you are a gentleman, three girls will come; but if you are a
    lady, three yound men will be involved.</p>
    <p>Then the three will draw lots as to whom is to stay with you. If the operator is a man, the girl
    who wins will sit in the chair which you have placed by the bed, and she will stay and be with
    you until midnight. At this time she will leave, with her companions, without having been
    dismissed.</p>
    <p>The two others will stay by the fire, while the first entertains you.</p>
    <p>While she is with you, you may ask her any question, about any art or science, or upon any
    subject at all, and she will at once give you a definite reply. You can ask the whereabouts of
    hidden treasure, and she will tell you where it is, and how and when to remove it. If the treasure
    is under the guardianship of infernal spirits, she will come herself, with her companions, and
    defend you against these fiends.</p>
    <p>When she leaves, she will give you a ring. If you wear this on your finger, you will be fortunate
    at gambling. If you place it on the finger of any woman or girl, you will be able at once to
    obtain your will of her. Note: The window is to be left open. You can do this experiment as
    often as you please.</p>

    <p>Experiment of a marvelous power of the superior intelligences.</p>
    <p>Watch for the crescent or the waning <a href="/astrological_body/moon">moon</a>, and when you see it, make sure that you see also a
    star, between the hours of eleven and midnight. Before beginning the process, do thus:
    Take a virgin <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>, and write on it the name of the girl whom you desire to come. The
    shape of the parchment is to be as you see in this figure:
    On the other side of the parchment, write MELCHIAEL, BARESCHAS. Then put the
    parchment on the earth, with the part where the name of the person is written next to the
    ground. Place your right foot upon the parchment, and your left knee, bent, upon the ground.</p>
    <p>Then look to the highest star in the sky, while in this position. In your right hand hold a taper of
    white <a href="/ingredient/wax">wax</a>, sufficiently large to burn for one hour. Then say the following:
    The Conjuration.</p>
    <p>I salute thee and conjure thee, O beautiful Moon, O most beautiful Star, O brilliant light which
    I have in my hand. By the light which I have in my hand. By the air that I breathe within me, by
    the earth that I am touching: I conjure thee. By the names of the spirit princes living in you. By
    the ineffable name ON, which created everything! By you, O resplendent angel <a href="/angel/gabriel">GABRIEL</a>,
    with the planet <a href="/astrological_body/mercury/">Mercury</a>, Prince, MICHIAEL and MELCHIDAEL.</p>
    <p>I conjure you again, by all the Holy <a href="/ingredient/names-of-god">Names of God</a>, so that you may send down power to
    oppress, torture and harass the body and soul and the five senses of N., she whose name is
    written here, so that she may come unto me. Let her then be tortured, made to suffer. Go, then,
    at once! Go, MELCHIDAEL, BARESCHES, ZAZEL, FIRIEL, MALCHA, and all those who
    are with thee! I conjure you by the Great Living God to obey my will, and I, N., promise to
    satisfy you.</p>
    <p>When this conjuration has been said three times, burn the <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a> with the taper. On the
    next day, take the <a href="/ingredient/parchment">parchment</a>, put it in your left shoe, and let it stay there until the person whom
    you have called comes to seek you out. In the conjuration you must say the date that she is to
    come, and she will not be absent.</p>

    <p>Collect seven black beans. Start the rite on a <a href="/day_of_the_week/wednesday">Wednesday</a>, before sunrise. Then take the head of
    a dead man, and put one of the black beans in his mouth, two in his eyes and two in his ears.</p>
    <p>Then make upon his head the character of <a href="/demon/morail">Morail</a>.</p>
    <p>When you have done this, bury the head, with the face upwards, and for nine days, before
    sunrise, water it each morning with excellent <a href="/ingredient/brandy">brandy</a>. On the eighth day you will find the spirit
    mentioned, who will say to you: &quot;What wilt thou?&quot;</p>
    <p>You will reply: &quot;I am watering my plant.&quot; Then the spirit will say: &quot;Give me the bottle, I desire
    to water it myself.&quot; In answer, refuse him this, even though he will ask you again.</p>
    <p>Then he will reach out with his hand, and will display to you that same figure which you have
    drawn upon the head. Now you can be sure that it is the right spirit, the spirit of the head.</p>
    <p>There is a danger that another one might try to trick you, which would have evil
    consequences—and in that case your operation would not succeed.</p>
    <p>Then you may give him the bottle, and he will water the head and leave. On the next day--
    which is the ninth--when you return, you will find the beans that are germinating. Take them
    and put them in your mouth, and look at yourself in the <a href="/ingredient/mirror">mirror</a>. If you can see nothing, it is
    well. Test the others in the same way, either in your own mouth, or in that of a <a href="/creature/child">child</a>. Those
    which do not confer invisibility are to be reburied with the head.</p>

    <p>Tear out the hair of a mare in heat, by the roots, closest to the nature, saying DRAGNE,
    DRAGNE, DRAGNE. Then tie them into a knot. Now go out and buy, without dispute over
    the price, a new pot of earthenware, which shall have a lid. Return to your house as fast as you
    can, fill the pot with water from a spring, until it is not quite full. Place the knotted hairs in it,
    cover it, and place it where neither you nor anyone else can see it, for there is danger in this.</p>
    <p>After nine days, at the hidden hour, bring out the pot and open it, and you will find that there is
    a small animal like a snake therein. This fill jump up. Then say: I ACCEPT THE PACT.</p>
    <p>Do not touch the animal with your hand. Place it in a new box, which you have bought for this
    purpose, and that withouth bargaining as to price. You must feed the creatue on <a href="/plant/wheat">wheat</a>-husks
    alone, daily.</p>
    <p>When you need <a href="/metal/gold">gold</a> or <a href="/metal/silver">silver</a>, place as much as you require in the box. Go to bed, with the box
    at the side of the bed. Sleep, if you desire, for three or four hours. Rise, then, and you will find
    that the money you have placed in the box has been doubled. But what you put first into the
    box must be left in it.</p>
    <p>If it is an ordinary-looking snake, you should not ask for more than one hundred francs at each
    time. If, however, it has a human face, then you will be able to obtain a thousand francs each
    time.</p>
    <p>If you want to kill the creature, place in the box instead of its daily husks, some of the <a href="/ingredient/flour">flour</a>
    which has been used fo the consecration in the first Mass said by the priest. After eating this it
    will die. Above all, do not omit anything, because this is not intended as a joke!</p>

    <p>Go out of the house, fasting; march to your left untilyou find a ribbon-seller. Buy one ell of
    white <a href="/ingredient/ribbon">ribbon</a>. Pay what is asked, and drop a farthing (un liard) into the box.</p>
    <p>Return home by the same route. Next day do the same, until you have found a seller of pens.</p>
    <p>Buy one, as you bought the <a href="/ingredient/ribbon">ribbon</a>. When you are locked in your own room, write with your
    own <a href="/ingredient/human-blood">blood</a> on the ribbon the characters of the third line on the plan. This is the right garter.</p>
    <p>Those of the fourth line are for the left. [These are presumably the planetary symbols in the
    concentric circles of the plan of the Grimoire.]</p>
    <p>When this is done, go out. The third day after, take your <a href="/ingredient/ribbon">ribbon</a> and pen, walk to the left until
    you find a pastry cook or bakery. Buy a cake or <a href="/ingredient/bread">bread</a> for a halfpenny. Go to the first tavern,

    other side of the garter the two names of these spirits with your <a href="/ingredient/human-blood">blood</a>. Throw down the third
    piece, saying, ERLY, FOR THEE. Throw down the pen, drink the <a href="/ingredient/wine">wine</a> without eating, pay the
    cost and go away.</p>
    <p>Being outside the town, take the garters, make no mistake as to which is the right and which the
    left. This is important. Stamp three times with the foot on the ground, pronounce the names of
    the spirits TERLY, ERLY, BALTAZARD, IRLY, MELCHIOR, GASPARD, LET US GO.</p>

    <p>Hit the nail with a stone, saying:<br>Curse evil to N . . ., until I remove thee.</p>
    <p>Re-cover the place with a little dust, and remember it well, because one cannot remove the evil
    which this causes, but by removing the nail, and saying:
    I remove thee, so that the evil which thou has caused to N..., shall cease. In the Name of the
    Father, and of the Son. and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
    <p>Then take the nail out, and efface the characters: not with the same hand as you make them, but
    with the other. Thus it will be without danger.</p>
